00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.066
Huh?

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:41.398
Hm.

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:44.314
Stuart.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.522
Illumination!

00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:33.323
Phil, Ron, Ralph, stay tuned.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.820
Okay, okay.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.487
Hm.

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.651
Okay. Our target is Maxime Le Mal,

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:47.319
Which the Active Catchers of Charge
must catch.

00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:50.487
And believe me, a nasty little guy.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.988
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:55.072
Si, boss.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.073
O. Phil, Ron!

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:10.364
Huh?
-Looka. Looka!

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:14.864
Come here, come here!

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.153
Jello!

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.614
Help me, help me!

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:26.698
Huppa!

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.368
- Help me!
- Hm, yummy.

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.698
Children can be cruel,
but Maxime is even more cruel.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:44.861
So, so, so. Look who's there.
There we have Gruser the Loser.

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:48.614
So, there you have Maxime Le Mal.
You look...

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:51.530
Magnificent out? Yes, I know.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:56.322
What did you think? That I would look like
like a bald loser with a beer belly?

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:59.655
Oops, way ahead of me, non?
-Well...

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.906
Oeeeeeh.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:05.491
Ugh.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.199
Laughter is fun, non?

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.947
Well, do you remember
my friend, Valentina?

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.200
She was captain
of the Femme Fatale cheerleaders

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.739
and the most popular girl
of the school.

00:04:18.827 --> 00:04:22.448
Yes, I know.
Nice to see you, Valentina.

00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:24.032
Hmpf.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.408
What am I hearing, Gru?

00:04:27.492 --> 00:04:33.116
All your dreams of becoming famous
as a villain, which went ... poof-poof?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.072
I don't know if you know,
but I managed to steal the moon.

00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:40.581
Really? You mean that moon?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.156
Is it on?
May I have your attention please?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.956
Good evening and welcome,
former students of Lycée Pas Bon.

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:56.909
We kick off the festivities
with the announcement of the winner

00:04:56.993 --> 00:05:01.325
Of our coveted trophy:
The Golden Former Pupil.

00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:06.365
And now, I no longer beat around the bush.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.826
This year's winner
of The Golden Former Apprentice is....

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:12.786
Um... Oh!

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:16.494
My favorite student, Maxime Le Mal.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.410
What, but you can't do that, can you?
-Thank you, thank you.

00:05:19.494 --> 00:05:22.786
Merci, merci beaucoup.
Non, there's really no need.

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.951
Oh, thank you. Thank you... Thank you.

00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:36.827
You guys probably already know.
I have something very big in the works right now.

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:42.203
You know, there was laughter, because as a
kid was always dealing with cockroaches.

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:47.495
But I soon saw that cockroaches
are a miracle of evolution.

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:48.826
Wow. Wow.

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:53.330
And I am now able
to harness the power and the speed.

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:55.035
And the... What is the word?

00:05:55.119 --> 00:06:00.160
The implacability of
the most powerful being in the world.

00:06:00.604 --> 00:06:05.543
And that makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.327
Maxime, Maxime, Maxime.

00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:12.668
Behold the powers of the cockroach.

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:40.454
Oh, oh stop. Stop!

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:44.662
And sad boyfriend of mine,
what do you have to say to this?

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:47.413
Well, I say you...

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:51.869
have been arrested
On behalf of the Active Catchers of Charge!

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:56.414
I didn't think so, mon ami.
-O no? Slime grenade.

00:06:57.914 --> 00:06:58.914
Oh.

00:07:00.998 --> 00:07:01.998
Hops.

00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:05.607
Ho, ha.

00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:09.662
Coming in.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:12.454
Stay where you are!

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.083
Huh, Huh.

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.163
Haaa.

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:25.087
Stay put.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.607
Halt!

00:07:32.964 --> 00:07:34.540
Got it.

00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:36.124
Non, non, non. Non.

00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:39.331
Surely this is impossible. C'est impossible.

00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:41.208
Hands off me, all of you.

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:44.748
I command you to let go of me.

00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:48.373
Goodbye, Maxime.
Who's the loser now?

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:50.416
Loser, loser, loser.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.163
Aaaaah!

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:03.376
This is not over!

00:08:04.757 --> 00:08:08.416
You can't let the AVL
out in front of you, coward.

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:11.625
Mark my words.
I'm going to exterminate you, Gru.

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:13.833
What...

00:08:18.418 --> 00:08:21.002
Um, not creepy, mind you.

00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:39.878
Hello, everyone.
Gru, what's up?

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.082
Yay, Gru.

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.835
I'm so glad you're here.
-Everything kits at the Gru-tjes?

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:46.959
Look what I taught Guit.

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:49.167
Guitje, sit.

00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:54.798
Oh Guitje, I said "sit.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.835
Well, he's only had
had one lesson, mind you.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:03.459
Maybe we should
practice outside from now on.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:07.168
There's my darling husband.
Did you bring milk too?

00:09:07.612 --> 00:09:12.959
Yes indeed, they had all sorts of things. Almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk, oat milk,

00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:17.836
goat milk, chocolate milk, coconut milk,
powdered milk and I have cleansing milk.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:22.132
Do you also have regular milk?
-No, they don't make that anymore.

00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:23.461
Ho.

00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:25.336
Wait a minute.

00:09:25.424 --> 00:09:29.376
One, two, three girls, one woman....

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:34.797
So something is missing.
-No, I believe we are complete. Yup.

00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:38.093
Or for that matter? I'm forgetting something. This one here!

00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.801
That's my boy. There he is.

00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:49.422
Where is daddy's kiss?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.614
Oh, who's a little cranky here?

00:09:52.878 --> 00:09:58.005
Even though you are a sourpuss,
you love your daddy.

00:09:58.085 --> 00:10:01.669
Go on. Say: Daddy. Daddy.

00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:06.586
Of course he loves you, but
he doesn't show it on his face.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.754
Or with his body language.

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:12.462
Right, Gru Junior? Come on, show daddy
how much you love him.

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:16.546
Oh, I do know what makes you happy.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.838
Hmmm, Bahama stew.

00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:28.422
No. It's from the Bahamas,
very far away. Look, oh, so yummy.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.631
That really has a Caribbean vibe.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.800
See? He loves his daddy.
He shares it.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.715
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:50.756
Brushing briefly.

00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:53.384
Polishing.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:11.801
Thanks, guys.

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:16.880
Rattle bum?

00:11:18.057 --> 00:11:19.057
Bips.

00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:22.173
I need to have a word with you.
-Sure, but...

00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.479
There is no time for chatter.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.514
Maxime Le Mal sent a message
sent from his cell.

00:11:29.633 --> 00:11:33.425
Bonjour, Gru.
I know you're listening, so listen.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:37.474
You think you can humiliate me?
And get away with it? Yes?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.134
So don't. If I escape
escape, I will come and take revenge on you, Gru.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.618
But this time I will
not be gentle with you.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.842
And I know where you live.

00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:53.091
So I would just sleep with one eye open,
because you can't hide.

00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:55.427
Sleep tight, Gruser.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:02.926
Don't worry, he can't get out of there anyway.
It's a very heavily guarded prison.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.174
Ah, yes, well, um....

00:12:05.698 --> 00:12:07.551
He escaped yesterday.
-What?

00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.675
Out of our house?

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:13.051
Oh no, you think that's super.
It's called a safe house.

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:17.091
And that's fun. And that's safe.
And that's great. And we're going.

00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:20.091
You are getting a new room
And a new school.

00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:23.092
That will be fun, right?
Everything all new. Nice.

00:12:23.184 --> 00:12:24.468
What about my friends?

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:27.176
You do make new ones.
Probably better ones.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.383
Unbelievable.

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:34.884
Yes yes, lots of emotions, different life.
No weeping, hup with those legs.

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:36.636
Go ahead, come on.

00:12:46.384 --> 00:12:49.805
I'm so sorry
That you can't come with me, Guitje.

00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:54.177
Are you taking good care of him?

00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:56.886
Be nice, Guitje.

00:12:56.978 --> 00:12:59.726
Don't forget to practice your tricks.

00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:07.177
We will be in a few hours
at the safe house.

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.723
Mayflower is a lovely little town.

00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:13.846
A lovely, safe and boring town.
Believe me, this is the best, Gru.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.929
What about grandma? What about Uncle Dru?

00:13:17.013 --> 00:13:19.969
Sorry, no one can know
where you are.

00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:23.430
Not even the family.
-Every disadvantage has its advantage.

00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:26.178
You promise to
take care of the other Minions?

00:13:26.702 --> 00:13:29.015
Those are sitting high and dry
in the AVL headquarters.

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.347
I have big plans for them.

00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.722
Well, good luck with that.

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:54.764
Now enough is enough!

00:14:02.473 --> 00:14:04.680
Silence!

00:14:06.187 --> 00:14:09.596
You are now on Carl's bus.

00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:13.140
And Karl is a longtime employee
at the AVL,

00:14:13.224 --> 00:14:16.016
Who wants to reach retirement age
wants to reach.

00:14:16.104 --> 00:14:21.224
So here in Karl's bus
you stick to Karl's rules.

00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:25.472
No mischief, no shenanigans,
no old-boy crap.

00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:26.765
Currant bread?

00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:28.765
So this stops.

00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:33.724
Or you will be introduced to a side
of Karl that you don't want to know.

00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:36.105
Is that clear, gentlemen?

00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:38.057
Bazooka!

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:51.438
Karl doesn't like this. Hands off.
What are you doing? Don't squeeze! No, no!

00:14:57.626 --> 00:15:00.643
We are here.
The town of Mayflower.

00:15:00.731 --> 00:15:04.934
This safe house has been used for years
to protect our agents.

00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:09.606
Oh, look at that.
Wow, those lawns, those flowers!

00:15:09.682 --> 00:15:13.018
- Wow, that's cool.
- Are we literally going to live here?

00:15:13.098 --> 00:15:16.683
Look at that fountain.
-Wow. Fat cool.

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:20.142
- Oooh, oooh, is that our house?
- Oh, look at that!

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:23.603
- Oh, how beautiful!
- I could get used to this.

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:29.643
It looks like there
a princess lives there.

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.100
And here it is.

00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:35.192
Your new home.

00:15:40.684 --> 00:15:41.684
O.

00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:46.604
No fountain.
-I'm sure it will be fun here.

00:15:46.688 --> 00:15:47.769
Come on.

00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:52.100
According to Silas, there is a swimming pool
in the garden. Now that's fun, isn't it?

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:03.353
Wow, it's so cold and unsociable.

00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:05.354
But in a homely way.

00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:08.893
Yes, it is according to the standards
of the AVL set up.

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:12.645
Little comfort, but a generous enough
for functionality.

00:16:12.729 --> 00:16:17.477
There is even an automatic
emergency lock. Isn't that fun?

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:19.769
Ow, an emergency lock.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:21.186
Yippee.

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:25.693
It has a candy machine.
Too crazy this house!

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.898
See.

00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:34.398
Ouch.

00:16:34.478 --> 00:16:36.355
Hoppa.
-Ha.

00:16:36.439 --> 00:16:39.814
This is going to be great.
-Beautiful, and now to the point.

00:16:39.902 --> 00:16:43.602
For your safety,
you will be given a new identity.

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:48.354
Do we really need them then?
-No discussion possible, Gru.

00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:50.979
Well, you are a salesman
of solar panels.

00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:54.603
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
in an upscale hair salon.

00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:58.395
A hair stylist? Yes, jackpot.

00:16:58.479 --> 00:17:02.980
Did you pick that because I cut my own
hair cut and I'm going to flame in this?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.480
No.

00:17:05.148 --> 00:17:09.604
Chet Cunningham?
Ah, that actually sounds nice.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.148
Girls.

00:17:11.232 --> 00:17:14.027
Cool, I'm Beril.

00:17:14.103 --> 00:17:17.063
Britney?
-My name is Brie?

00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:21.632
Oh come on, there are worse names.
-Yes, like Bea.

00:17:21.856 --> 00:17:25.896
Yes, Margot. Bea, what a terrible name.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.104
How sad if your name is Bea.

00:17:29.196 --> 00:17:31.104
Really, I don't know a worse name....

00:17:31.944 --> 00:17:33.396
My name is Bea, isn't it?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.649
Yep.

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:36.773
Well, that takes some getting used to.

00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:42.029
You girls go pick out a room
pick a room, and I'll talk to your parents.

00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:46.857
Yes, I didn't want to scare the girls,

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.734
but it is vitally important
that you keep your identities secret.

00:17:50.822 --> 00:17:54.649
Gru, I have to ask you,
please don't be Gru-ish.

00:17:54.737 --> 00:17:56.441
What do you mean by that?

00:17:56.529 --> 00:18:00.774
I'm just saying that you often stand out
in a crowd and no more.

00:18:00.858 --> 00:18:04.442
You know. Um... Like when you're
cranky and irritable.

00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:08.191
And if you make it a little uncomfortable
for everybody.

00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:09.858
Yes, you do.

00:18:09.942 --> 00:18:11.982
I mean, you know...
-Okay, enough.

00:18:12.074 --> 00:18:15.067
I don't make people
feel uncomfortable.

00:18:15.155 --> 00:18:18.982
I comfort all people,
just like a plum cake.

00:18:19.074 --> 00:18:21.066
I am quite manageable.

00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:28.066
This is not uncomfortable.
You are making it uncomfortable.

00:18:28.154 --> 00:18:33.443
Gru, you must not stand out. Your family
is in mortal danger. Do you understand?

00:18:33.531 --> 00:18:38.191
Sure, yes. We understand that. We do
everything for the safety of our family.

00:18:38.715 --> 00:18:41.567
Right, beautiful. I'll be in touch
when everything is over.

00:18:41.651 --> 00:18:46.823
Until then, bringing in
of Maxime Le Mal is our top priority.

00:18:47.984 --> 00:18:49.652
Stay safe.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.360
You know, maybe this is
not so bad.

00:18:54.444 --> 00:18:58.608
No chasing villains
or dangerous missions, right?

00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:01.192
We can be an ordinary family.

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:06.485
And then I finally get to
to some quality time with the baby.

00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:09.193
This is going to be really great. Right, buddy?

00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:10.909
Who grabs your nose? Who...

00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:13.909
He grabs my nose.

00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:14.985
Ouch.

00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:18.576
He can squeeze hard. That kid is strong.

00:19:28.072 --> 00:19:29.072
Ah.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.781
Thanks. Need to see you guys.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.822
We're having fun, right?

00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:15.654
I love you guys.
Thank you, my wonderful army.

00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:18.307
Maxime is back, yes!

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:26.363
A special merci beaucoup to those who
helped me escape from the AVL prison.

00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:28.363
Tom and Linda, where are you?

00:20:28.447 --> 00:20:32.698
Yes, distracting the guards....
Oh, très magnifique.

00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:34.907
Now silence!

00:20:35.407 --> 00:20:38.491
We make Gru pay for my arrest.

00:20:40.174 --> 00:20:45.163
And what better way to do that than by
kidnapping his precious little baby.

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:47.531
Oh, I want to have that baby.

00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:52.448
Oh, Maxime.
-Non, non, wait, wait.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.532
Not Maxime. You'll call me
Cockroach Man from now on, huh?

00:20:57.616 --> 00:21:01.324
Seems a little obvious,
but it's very obvious. Cool, isn't it?

00:21:01.408 --> 00:21:06.325
I won't call you by that stupid name,
but I am so in favor of this vicious plan.

00:21:06.413 --> 00:21:11.073
Well, Gru asked. He humiliated me
humiliated me and in front of the whole school.

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:14.117
I had my trophy and all that stuff.

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:17.409
But now the game begins.

00:21:17.497 --> 00:21:22.658
He may run away like the mouse,
but we find him like the cat.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.749
Game on.

00:21:28.285 --> 00:21:29.285
Stop.

00:21:29.661 --> 00:21:30.662
Stop.

00:21:31.077 --> 00:21:32.201
Stop.

00:21:32.285 --> 00:21:33.409
Stop!

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:37.449
Stop!

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:42.034
Okay, here are Chet's scrambled eggs
nice and full of cheese.

00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:45.410
And Bea's famous bacon,
that spell your name.

00:21:45.874 --> 00:21:48.706
Please, Britney.

00:21:49.706 --> 00:21:55.327
Wait. I can't say my
Britney's name. Because then I would be joking.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:56.703
Yes.

00:21:56.791 --> 00:21:59.327
But we are not allowed to jockey at all.

00:21:59.415 --> 00:22:03.659
You shouldn't think of it as jockeying.
Just think of it as a form of pretending.

00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:05.867
Oh no, I don't.

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.451
Ah, a little white lie.
-No.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.868
Agnes, I am your father
And I command you to jockey.

00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:14.076
No.
-Yes, joking.

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.659
You are treading on thin ice, young lady.

00:22:17.743 --> 00:22:18.787
Hmm.

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:24.744
Why don't you look more
like your sister, Edith? That one jokes all the time.

00:22:24.828 --> 00:22:28.288
I don't.
-See? See? Now she's joking again.

00:22:28.368 --> 00:22:30.204
And well too, I must say.

00:22:30.288 --> 00:22:33.119
Okay, this is our first day
at Mayflower.

00:22:33.203 --> 00:22:37.120
And as far as I'm concerned, this is going to be a great
day. Right, Chet Junior?

00:22:37.204 --> 00:22:40.368
Woohoe! Mayflower, yoo-hoo!

00:22:40.452 --> 00:22:43.868
We're going to be late for karate.
-You have to take Margot to school.

00:22:44.313 --> 00:22:46.497
- Yippee.
- It must be cool.

00:22:46.577 --> 00:22:49.204
Hey, you just have to dare to be yourself

00:22:49.288 --> 00:22:52.913
and then Mayflower will take Chet Cunningham
into his heart.

00:22:53.753 --> 00:22:55.497
They're going to love him as much
as I do.

00:22:56.417 --> 00:23:00.630
And you, little man, you're going to have so much fun
with your daddy.

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:01.578
Mom.

00:23:01.662 --> 00:23:06.621
Yep, just you and Dad.
Come on, say it then. Dad.

00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:08.293
Dad.

00:23:12.162 --> 00:23:14.246
Yes, this will be a fun day.

00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:30.622
Hup, hup, hup, hup.

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:32.037
Huppakee.

00:23:33.755 --> 00:23:33.831
Okay.

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:35.706
No, go!

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.586
Thank you, guys.

00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:43.747
Baby.
-Hup, check, chok, chik, check, check, yes.

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:49.707
- All right, thank you, doll.
- Hi huh!

00:23:50.415 --> 00:23:52.371
Look, Margot. The neighbors.

00:23:52.455 --> 00:23:55.291
Hello!
-Hm?

00:23:55.379 --> 00:23:57.872
Come with me. You can do this, Chet.

00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:03.208
Your new neighbor, Chet Cunningham.

00:24:03.292 --> 00:24:09.372
Uhuh, Perry Prescott.
What brought you here, Chet?

00:24:09.464 --> 00:24:10.504
Well...

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:11.708
Um...

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.541
Solar panels. Yes, that!
I sell solar panels.

00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:19.417
Are you already participating in the solar revolution?

00:24:19.505 --> 00:24:23.081
Yes, no. I am already provided for.

00:24:23.173 --> 00:24:26.081
Good to know.
And what do you actually do, Perry?

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:31.749
I have Prescott Motors,
the largest car dealer in the state.

00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:34.333
Wow, impressive.

00:24:34.417 --> 00:24:37.624
This is my daughter Margot.
-Brie, Dad.

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:39.317
Ah, yes.

00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:43.333
Yes, did I say Margot?
How funny, because I was thinking....

00:24:43.417 --> 00:24:47.334
I thought of a fish
I had as a child named Margot.

00:24:47.418 --> 00:24:51.501
He lived in the pond and he died.

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:53.457
Um...

00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:55.210
Anyway...

00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:59.918
Um... I'm about to take Brie to
school for her first day.

00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:02.794
Yeah, I was just about to take
to school, so...

00:25:02.874 --> 00:25:07.294
Poppy? Hello, Poppy.
What a nice name that is.

00:25:07.374 --> 00:25:10.666
Would you like to carpool with us?
-No.

00:25:10.758 --> 00:25:16.399
You can become friends with Brie.
Right? You don't have any friends at all.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.880
Well, nice banter, Chet,
but she has school

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.043
and I go with some friends
of mine to the tennis club.

00:25:25.135 --> 00:25:27.127
Oe, tennis club. That sounds like fun!

00:25:27.211 --> 00:25:30.588
If I were to be invited
To a tennis club,

00:25:30.672 --> 00:25:33.252
Then I would love that.

00:25:34.503 --> 00:25:38.919
Yes ... Well, we really have to get going now,
so nice knowing you, Chet.

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:46.043
Yes, fun chatting! If you ever want to
want to do, we can just chat!

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:49.552
He does start chatting.
-That was painful.

00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:59.712
Just watch, by this afternoon you will have forgotten
who your old, rotten friends were.

00:25:59.796 --> 00:26:02.213
Mm, I'm not so sure about that yet.

00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:09.213
Really isn't it? Oh my gosh.

00:26:09.297 --> 00:26:10.753
Not my problem, bro.

00:26:12.213 --> 00:26:14.381
Hey honey, you can do this.

00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:18.670
You are smart. You're funny.
You don't have to worry, right?

00:26:18.762 --> 00:26:21.086
They're going to like you.

00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:23.510
Thank you, Gru.

00:26:25.506 --> 00:26:26.878
Bye bye.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.346
Oh, let them like you.

00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:37.922
Hi, Poppy.

00:26:41.714 --> 00:26:43.174
Um...

00:26:45.546 --> 00:26:46.546
Huh?

00:26:47.046 --> 00:26:50.463
Drive!
-Sorry, mistake. I'm already going.

00:26:50.547 --> 00:26:52.427
Okay, I'm going already!

00:26:54.507 --> 00:26:56.170
Ugh, buttocks.

00:27:17.592 --> 00:27:18.592
Huh?

00:27:23.801 --> 00:27:26.588
All right, gentlemen. Arise.

00:27:28.388 --> 00:27:31.133
You may be wondering
What you are doing here.

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:32.509
Um, sí.

00:27:32.597 --> 00:27:36.509
As you may or may not know,
I had to interrupt my retirement

00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:41.672
to lead the project of the
AVL to deal with Maxime Le Mal.

00:27:41.764 --> 00:27:45.764
And that is why you are here.
I'm looking for volunteers.

00:27:47.141 --> 00:27:50.633
I need the strongest, the heftiest.
-O.

00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:52.089
The fearless.
-Nope.

00:27:52.173 --> 00:27:54.758
I look for the best of the best.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.049
So, which one of you will it be?

00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:02.048
Yes, very good, gentlemen.

00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:03.050
Huh?

00:28:05.758 --> 00:28:09.426
The AVL is known
for high-tech weapons and vehicles.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.049
But now we are also developing
high-tech agents.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.510
And I can't imagine better test animals
than you.

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:19.303
Test animals, yes!

00:28:19.391 --> 00:28:22.759
You are the first ones
to test our super serum.

00:28:22.843 --> 00:28:27.095
Designed to turn you into
top agents with powers and abilities

00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:29.927
that those of mere mortals
exceed those of ordinary mortals.

00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:35.259
Whether you explode.
We don't know yet.

00:28:35.343 --> 00:28:36.720
Um, huh?

00:28:39.804 --> 00:28:41.887
Hey.

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:52.720
Yes.

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:57.768
Yes!

00:28:59.327 --> 00:29:00.328
O?

00:29:16.513 --> 00:29:21.769
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I bring you the Mega Minions.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.593
Cool.

00:29:30.677 --> 00:29:35.222
Ah, how cute you guys
looking cute. And very cool and scary.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.470
It would be even better
With a black belt. Hi-yah!

00:29:38.554 --> 00:29:39.386
Oh, oh.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.679
I'm going to break a brick with my head.
-That's the way to hear it. Ow.

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:47.305
Okay. Have fun. I'm going to get to work.

00:29:47.393 --> 00:29:50.846
Beril and Britney, yes?
-Hm.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.178
Will do.
-Okay, bye, mom.

00:29:54.262 --> 00:29:55.262
Day.

00:29:56.262 --> 00:29:57.139
Got it.

00:29:57.223 --> 00:29:58.387
Hi-yah!

00:29:58.471 --> 00:29:59.807
In the circle, people.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.554
Hiyah.

00:30:02.638 --> 00:30:07.431
Show respect for your sensei.
-Yes, sensei O'Sullivan.

00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:09.599
Hai!

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:16.683
Boscovitch, did I not order you
to cut that hair?

00:30:16.763 --> 00:30:20.331
You look like a sheepdog.
-Sorry, sensei.

00:30:21.648 --> 00:30:26.194
Well, we have two newcomers today
who want to start their journey

00:30:26.195 --> 00:30:28.888
on superness.

00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:33.471
You, ukkepuk. Come forward
And tell me your name.

00:30:33.472 --> 00:30:34.724
Um...

00:30:34.812 --> 00:30:36.432
It's Britney.

00:30:37.432 --> 00:30:38.557
Um...

00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:40.481
What is my name?

00:30:41.725 --> 00:30:43.809
You can't.

00:30:43.897 --> 00:30:48.848
There is no "can't" in karate.
Ten push-ups after class.

00:30:48.932 --> 00:30:50.388
Hey, that's not fair.

00:30:51.348 --> 00:30:52.348
How-ha.

00:30:52.388 --> 00:30:55.641
I wouldn't be mouthing off
To your sensei.

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.096
Hiyah!

00:30:57.097 --> 00:31:00.933
Well, are you ready to say
your name and to join in?

00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:03.057
Hmm.

00:31:03.141 --> 00:31:05.181
I don't think so.

00:31:05.265 --> 00:31:09.309
Then sit in the corner
Of shame and reflection

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:12.390
And ask yourself what kind of person you want to be.

00:31:17.414 --> 00:31:20.890
Good. Am I gonna have
get in trouble with you?

00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:24.350
Yes, probably.
-What do you say?

00:31:24.434 --> 00:31:29.231
If you think I don't fight with children
fight, you're in the wrong dojo.

00:31:37.227 --> 00:31:38.059
Ha!

00:31:38.143 --> 00:31:40.395
Ouch!

00:31:46.232 --> 00:31:48.651
That was for my sister.

00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:50.058
Huh?

00:31:51.483 --> 00:31:55.851
You broke my little toe!

00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:58.859
That's going to be a lot of push-ups.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.520
Okay, here comes this.
Hair gel.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.475
Mrs. Cunningham?
-Oh, um, yes, um, hi.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:09.644
I must say, what a beautiful resume you have.

00:32:09.732 --> 00:32:13.060
Oh, what shall I say?
I'm good at what I do.

00:32:13.152 --> 00:32:16.061
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

00:32:16.145 --> 00:32:18.777
A lot of demanding divas here
in town.

00:32:21.568 --> 00:32:27.100
I'm at a loss for words, folks.
Where is what's-her-name? Renée? Rhonda?

00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:30.769
Melora, how sorry I am.
Rachel is on maternity leave.

00:32:30.853 --> 00:32:33.438
What, oh, but you just can't do that, can you?

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:38.353
But you're lucky,
because our Bea here is fantastic.

00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:40.522
Perfect. I am sitting in my chair.

00:32:41.686 --> 00:32:43.734
Okay missy, you may.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.478
And Melora, what are you in the mood for?

00:32:51.562 --> 00:32:54.477
What if we wash it
and let it air dry?

00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:57.102
Experience the power of nature, or so?

00:32:57.186 --> 00:33:02.522
No, I've had that style.
It's time for a whole new Melora.

00:33:02.602 --> 00:33:04.646
I want this.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.062
Wow ... Wow.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.069
Um...

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.854
Okay, we'll start with the color?

00:33:12.938 --> 00:33:15.231
Yes, the color. Because that's where you start.

00:33:17.363 --> 00:33:18.603
A little bit of this.

00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:20.687
Bit of that.

00:33:21.155 --> 00:33:24.187
And-oh, that's beautiful.
This is not so difficult.

00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:27.855
Um...

00:33:32.608 --> 00:33:33.608
What?

00:33:35.488 --> 00:33:40.064
Is it supposed to smoke?
-Yes, smoking means it works.

00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:42.564
Huh?

00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:51.605
What happens?
-Perfect. Don't panic.

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:54.273
Call the fire department!

00:33:59.364 --> 00:34:00.688
Walk, walk, walk.

00:34:02.148 --> 00:34:03.207
O.

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.697
Where do those go?

00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:10.188
Voilà!

00:34:10.272 --> 00:34:11.817
My latest creation.

00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:15.605
All my transformation powers
in one handheld design, lol.

00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:20.106
Oh, it's beautiful. And look at
see that little antenna! That is so cute.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.442
It's not supposed to be cute, non.

00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:25.317
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying even.

00:34:26.782 --> 00:34:29.566
Now all I have to do is
looking for that walking potato

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.234
And his baby is mine!

00:34:32.342 --> 00:34:33.942
Check this out here.

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.526
Wow.

00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:50.943
No, this is not a joke.
Really, these people here ... Whoa!

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.275
Oh, this is really going to be top notch!

00:35:22.408 --> 00:35:26.192
Okay, Daddy is just completely exhausted.

00:35:26.284 --> 00:35:29.692
Your diaper is changed. You have your bottle.
Your pacifier.

00:35:29.776 --> 00:35:34.821
And here are your balloons.
Look at that, you like those, don't you?

00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:37.741
Huh huh, a moment to myself.

00:35:57.698 --> 00:35:58.698
Hmm.

00:36:10.822 --> 00:36:14.154
They put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.326
Adolescents are terrible.

00:36:17.322 --> 00:36:18.322
Yes...

00:36:18.362 --> 00:36:20.662
Babies are no fun either.

00:36:27.278 --> 00:36:28.278
Junior!

00:36:42.863 --> 00:36:44.071
Ah, okay, okay.

00:36:46.112 --> 00:36:48.364
Dua Lipa prosciutto.

00:36:56.497 --> 00:36:57.497
Book coverage!

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.112
Puste, Ralph.

00:37:13.244 --> 00:37:15.028
- Hello, Gru.
- Hello.

00:37:15.112 --> 00:37:16.779
What, what? Um, what?

00:37:19.657 --> 00:37:22.657
Oh, hello, Poppy. Did you perhaps say something?

00:37:23.497 --> 00:37:27.114
What, um, no. My name is Chet, by the way.
Chet Cunningham.

00:37:27.198 --> 00:37:30.781
Gru? What? What does that even mean?

00:37:34.137 --> 00:37:35.574
That you are not good at lying.

00:37:36.058 --> 00:37:39.614
Hey, that's not nice.
Ever heard of respect for the elderly?

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:42.991
I have no respect for boomers.
I laugh at them.

00:37:43.075 --> 00:37:47.322
Is that sometimes
a joke? Did you get that one from the web?

00:37:47.406 --> 00:37:48.406
Wow.

00:37:48.498 --> 00:37:51.407
The web? How old are you?

00:37:51.499 --> 00:37:54.867
Well, old enough to know
that you are a nasty, little...

00:37:54.951 --> 00:37:55.951
Eh?

00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:57.951
I would just be careful.

00:37:58.615 --> 00:38:00.075
What Oeh...

00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:02.575
You have been a master villain.

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:06.782
That's not me.
I don't even look like that.

00:38:06.866 --> 00:38:10.782
You obviously have the wrong one in front of you,
because I'm selling...

00:38:10.783 --> 00:38:12.830
Um, solar panels.

00:38:12.831 --> 00:38:17.575
Oh, don't worry. I'm not going to expose you.
You're going to help me take a crack at it.

00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:22.123
We're going to make a plan tomorrow.
-You want to do a squat?

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:26.324
Listen missy, I'm not-
-No, you're listening, old man.

00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:32.952
I got you and I swear to you:
there is no mocking me.

00:38:33.032 --> 00:38:38.076
Okay, um, yeah well.
But tomorrow is not such a good time.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.408
Bummer for you.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.784
Because this is going to happen.

00:38:41.785 --> 00:38:47.248
Unless you want the whole world to know
exactly who you are.

00:38:50.373 --> 00:38:51.789
Gru.

00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:54.993
What a creep she is.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.285
Bello, bello, thank you!

00:39:11.493 --> 00:39:13.118
Yes!

00:39:13.202 --> 00:39:15.286
Hey hey, tap it! Tap it!

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.370
Yes!

00:39:21.502 --> 00:39:22.502
Oh, thank you!

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.954
Yay...

00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:27.410
Ah.

00:39:27.494 --> 00:39:28.829
Hey, Jiminy!

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.039
No problemo!

00:39:42.287 --> 00:39:43.411
Huh?

00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:44.495
Oh, pfjoew.

00:39:45.872 --> 00:39:49.287
Oi.

00:39:52.663 --> 00:39:54.504
Thank you.
-O.

00:39:56.372 --> 00:39:59.080
Okay, okay, quiet now.

00:39:59.164 --> 00:40:00.412
Quiet!

00:40:00.996 --> 00:40:02.121
Thank you.

00:40:02.213 --> 00:40:05.420
It's time to start training
in the real world.

00:40:05.496 --> 00:40:06.835
Liberty, yeah.

00:40:06.836 --> 00:40:12.496
And if you do well there,
you will become AVL's new secret weapon.

00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:14.204
Hey, pomodoro!

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.080
La pomodoro, hey!

00:40:19.064 --> 00:40:21.036
Ugh.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.421
I probably won't
no regrets.

00:40:29.585 --> 00:40:32.957
Well,
the painter cancelled.

00:40:33.045 --> 00:40:35.957
I don't know what...
Good morning, neighbors.

00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:40.081
Hello. You're still
me, right Perry?

00:40:41.081 --> 00:40:42.998
O!
-No. No, no.

00:40:43.082 --> 00:40:44.414
Yoo-hoo!
-Patsy...

00:40:44.506 --> 00:40:46.206
Hey, neighbors.
-Patsy.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:52.122
Hoi-eh, I'm Perry's wife Patsy.
-Oh, I'm Bea and this is Chet.

00:40:52.214 --> 00:40:55.082
Hi. Hey, you know, seeing you
standing here like this,

00:40:55.166 --> 00:40:58.830
then I get one
of my brilliant ideas.

00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:02.375
Perry is looking for tomorrow
a partner for tennis.

00:41:02.463 --> 00:41:06.666
I... I don't know. He just
a tennis fanatic.

00:41:07.547 --> 00:41:08.207
Not a tennis fanatic?

00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:11.499
I am an avid tennis fanatic.
I am Mister Tennis.

00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:14.878
It is my favorite
Of all the sports and games.

00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:19.623
With a racket like that and with those balls,
so pretty yellow and hairy.

00:41:20.958 --> 00:41:25.959
Settled, then. I'll see you two
at the club tomorrow. Toedeloe.

00:41:26.047 --> 00:41:28.631
Okay. Toedeloe, that's where we have to go.

00:41:30.068 --> 00:41:34.416
And, so you play tennis?
-Yes, yes, I play tennis.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.915
And quite fantastic actually.

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:39.123
Well, at least it used to be at summer camp.

00:41:39.215 --> 00:41:41.424
Oh, how good. Here you go.

00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:45.548
Okay, bye. Have fun!

00:41:47.175 --> 00:41:48.257
Check it out.

00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:51.045
Um, okay.

00:41:52.544 --> 00:41:53.544
What?

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:02.541
What should... Huh?

00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:21.918
Gru. You can't hide, Gru.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.917
Oh, my back. I can't hold it anymore.
How long is this going to last?

00:42:26.009 --> 00:42:28.501
Well, this takes as long as it takes.

00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:31.837
Mark my words: Gru is not going to win.

00:42:31.838 --> 00:42:34.254
This is not the talent show
from the third grade.

00:42:34.342 --> 00:42:36.670
Oh, here we go again.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.042
Yes, again yes. It was a decisive
moment. Why don't you let me?

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.211
It was on the night of the show.

00:42:47.087 --> 00:42:49.547
I had been practicing a song for weeks

00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:52.794
from which my classmates
would freak out.

00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:57.427
I wanted to stand up. Then...

00:42:57.503 --> 00:42:58.339
What?

00:42:58.427 --> 00:42:59.427
...I heard it.

00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:00.963
What Oh.

00:43:07.552 --> 00:43:11.592
There stood that little jerk
And he did my big number.

00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:16.088
He had ruined everything.

00:43:16.176 --> 00:43:19.464
I couldn't go on after him.
Then I would have been a fool.

00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:21.380
Like I was imitating him.

00:43:21.468 --> 00:43:25.627
Maybe it was purely coincidental.
It was just a popular song.

00:43:26.152 --> 00:43:29.340
Oh, non, non, non. He knew it.
He did it on purpose.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.672
He loved
to humiliate me.

00:43:32.672 --> 00:43:35.797
What now?
-Fuel has run out.

00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:41.464
There is always something. Why can't I ever
just be nice and bad?

00:43:41.544 --> 00:43:43.797
Okay, parking.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.799
Okay, let's see. Just unleaded.

00:44:15.883 --> 00:44:18.923
Oe, wow, that's pretty pricey, non.

00:44:19.015 --> 00:44:22.845
Okay, enter pass and quickly delete.

00:44:22.846 --> 00:44:24.299
Pass unreadable?

00:44:26.422 --> 00:44:27.630
Ah, come on.

00:44:28.074 --> 00:44:31.515
Did you remove it quickly, though?
-Yes, yes, it could hardly be any faster.

00:44:38.923 --> 00:44:42.007
Hey, bring me a slush.
It's my slush day.

00:44:43.339 --> 00:44:47.091
You there. Your stupid device
won't read my card.

00:44:47.175 --> 00:44:50.300
Did you remove it quickly?
-Yes.

00:44:50.388 --> 00:44:54.840
Well, some do it too fast.
You just have to try again.

00:44:54.932 --> 00:44:57.468
I don't have time for this!

00:44:58.384 --> 00:44:59.799
Okay, wait!

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.884
I am trying to destroy my enemy!

00:45:03.972 --> 00:45:07.801
So give me 3000 liters on pump four,
fool.

00:45:07.885 --> 00:45:11.841
Please, don't hurt me.
-O, but I'm not going to hurt you.

00:45:11.925 --> 00:45:14.177
What?

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:22.802
O.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.009
Look at you.

00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:26.425
Much better.

00:45:26.509 --> 00:45:28.472
And give me a purple slush, you.

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:33.261
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know. Lekker puh.

00:45:33.341 --> 00:45:35.841
Yes, I am that bad.

00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:41.802
Hm.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.094
Okay, you guys pick
a healthy granola.

00:45:45.178 --> 00:45:47.678
This is Guit's favorite muesli.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.926
He hasn't forgotten me, has he? Right?

00:45:52.434 --> 00:45:55.387
Oh dear, that's not possible at all.

00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:59.842
You play with Guitje and you dress him up
and you have a podcast.

00:45:59.934 --> 00:46:04.803
It's absolutely impossible that he's
forget you. His best friend.

00:46:05.803 --> 00:46:07.267
Thanks, Mom.

00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:14.427
Look, this one has extra marshmallows.
-Double sugared chocolate lumps.

00:46:14.511 --> 00:46:15.927
Yes, we'll take those.

00:46:16.887 --> 00:46:18.596
Okay, what else do we need?

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.304
Oh no.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.472
She didn't see anything.
She didn't notice anything.

00:46:28.928 --> 00:46:30.842
- What is it?
- Huh?

00:46:30.843 --> 00:46:35.804
Oh, nothing at all. Just, um, stretching,
before we move on.

00:46:35.888 --> 00:46:40.552
Grocery shopping is the cause of
muscle injuries. Didn't know that, did you?

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:47.596
Okay, stretched. Let's go.
Hup hup. Hup, hup, hup.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.344
Okay, the coast is clear...

00:46:52.513 --> 00:46:54.013
O.

00:46:55.473 --> 00:46:56.513
You.

00:46:58.437 --> 00:47:01.473
You did this. Cheater.

00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:03.849
Come, girls.
Cleaning crew, aisle nine.

00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:07.806
Have always wanted to say.
We are hiding here.

00:47:07.894 --> 00:47:11.554
What does the madam want from us?
-Madam? No ma'am seen.

00:47:14.855 --> 00:47:15.930
Madam!

00:47:16.022 --> 00:47:18.270
Come on. Get out of here. Faster!

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:19.182
Wow.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.222
You are not a hairdresser.

00:47:22.478 --> 00:47:24.055
I'm on to you.

00:47:24.147 --> 00:47:26.223
Come back, you.
-I have to get out of here.

00:47:43.515 --> 00:47:44.515
Okay.

00:47:51.603 --> 00:47:52.603
Come back, you.

00:47:52.683 --> 00:47:53.975
A, ah o.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600
Ha.
-Ho.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.852
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hey, no, no, no.

00:48:01.524 --> 00:48:04.892
You can't just...
Open, open, open!

00:48:12.017 --> 00:48:13.057
Wow.

00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:14.517
We go.

00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:21.141
Stop. Come here, you.

00:48:26.849 --> 00:48:30.850
That was in the nick of time. Always fun
when shopping with Mom.

00:48:30.942 --> 00:48:34.356
- You can't do better shopping!
- Now that's life!

00:49:06.566 --> 00:49:07.982
Perfecto.

00:49:09.026 --> 00:49:10.395
Poppy.

00:49:10.479 --> 00:49:12.815
Poppy.

00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:19.527
I don't see her, Junior.
-Bove you, smartass.

00:49:19.603 --> 00:49:20.859
You are too late.

00:49:21.983 --> 00:49:25.395
How do I get up there?
-With the trampoline.

00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:26.480
Huh?

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.484
Here we go.

00:49:45.188 --> 00:49:48.356
Au, au, au, au, au.

00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:06.068
Here I am, Poppy Prescott, villainess.

00:50:06.985 --> 00:50:09.817
Take a seat, Gru.
-Okay, I'll take...

00:50:12.089 --> 00:50:12.565
Okay.

00:50:12.653 --> 00:50:14.145
Okay, why am I here?

00:50:14.237 --> 00:50:19.190
Because, like you,
I am a born rogue.

00:50:19.274 --> 00:50:24.022
And now we need to talk
about our squat.

00:50:24.106 --> 00:50:27.194
Crack, please. You are only a child.

00:50:29.238 --> 00:50:31.607
Great villains start early.

00:50:31.691 --> 00:50:35.315
Didn't you steal the crown jewels
at age twelve?

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:39.070
I was a lot younger than that.
Sorry, but you are not me.

00:50:39.146 --> 00:50:43.022
I will most likely be
much better than you.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.522
Check this out here.

00:50:45.606 --> 00:50:49.315
Hey, is that my old school?
-Bingo.

00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:52.814
Which I expertly recreated
with glue and popsicle sticks.

00:50:53.646 --> 00:50:59.091
And what we're going to steal there for a while is:
the school mascot.

00:50:59.363 --> 00:51:02.239
Do you want to steal Lenny?
-I do.

00:51:02.315 --> 00:51:05.524
Lycée Pas Bon was always
my dream school.

00:51:05.608 --> 00:51:08.855
And this crack will look so good
in my rogue log.

00:51:08.947 --> 00:51:10.983
This is a very bad idea.

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:14.024
Have you ever seen a honey badger?

00:51:14.108 --> 00:51:16.276
They are nasty, mean monsters.

00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:20.277
They literally eat bees and cobras
at breakfast.

00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:22.357
That doesn't do honey badgers any good.

00:51:22.441 --> 00:51:24.856
No no, I'm really not going to help you.

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:30.365
Well, that's the pity of blackmail.
You don't really have a choice.

00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:46.817
Come along. Come along!

00:52:00.533 --> 00:52:01.534
Okay.

00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:03.861
O.

00:52:03.862 --> 00:52:05.986
Ah. Um, Tim?

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.650
Tim, go, go, go.

00:52:12.318 --> 00:52:13.817
Chihuahua.

00:52:20.695 --> 00:52:21.571
No!

00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:22.695
Stronger!

00:52:24.111 --> 00:52:25.111
You the best!

00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:29.611
Le salami!
-Le salami!

00:52:30.195 --> 00:52:32.863
Suppository!

00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:38.028
Give here!

00:52:38.116 --> 00:52:39.819
Hey, police!

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.903
No problemo.

00:52:42.527 --> 00:52:43.987
Hi-yah.

00:52:50.028 --> 00:52:52.028
Um, piña colada.

00:52:55.072 --> 00:52:56.235
Huh?

00:52:59.116 --> 00:53:00.536
Help!

00:53:03.324 --> 00:53:05.820
Please, can you help me?
-Ah, si, si.

00:53:12.196 --> 00:53:13.528
Huppa.

00:53:14.028 --> 00:53:16.529
Hey, all good. Ciao.

00:53:16.613 --> 00:53:17.865
Huh?

00:53:19.453 --> 00:53:21.537
Grease, come on.
-Hey.

00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:31.370
Thank you, thank you!

00:53:32.822 --> 00:53:34.282
Ugh, a smooch.

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:39.367
A smoochie.

00:53:39.655 --> 00:53:40.907
Woah.

00:53:43.654 --> 00:53:45.537
O!

00:53:46.369 --> 00:53:47.578
Help!

00:53:47.654 --> 00:53:50.238
Bazooka!

00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:08.655
Oh, um...

00:54:15.539 --> 00:54:18.539
Hey hey. Stop, stop. Police.

00:54:28.492 --> 00:54:30.076
Ciao bellos.

00:54:34.956 --> 00:54:38.949
Because of them my car is wrecked.
-They destroyed the cafe.

00:54:39.041 --> 00:54:41.657
- Get out you guys!
- They are destroying everything!

00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:45.205
I've had it with superheroes.
-Yes, we grab them.

00:54:48.364 --> 00:54:50.040
Get in. O.

00:54:50.908 --> 00:54:52.324
Bazooka!

00:54:52.409 --> 00:54:54.869
- Boo!
- Yes, off you go.

00:54:54.957 --> 00:54:58.825
Gentlemen, our experiment failed.

00:54:58.913 --> 00:55:01.868
You are officially sidelined.

00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:03.701
Playing outside!

00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:05.701
Huh? Um, no?

00:55:19.617 --> 00:55:21.701
Wow.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:22.869
There it is.

00:55:29.997 --> 00:55:35.078
The castle, the gargoyles.
Unbelievable that I am here.

00:55:41.787 --> 00:55:43.494
Okay.

00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:50.826
Come on. Then it's done.
Ron, my equipment.

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:51.750
Voilà.

00:55:51.834 --> 00:55:53.954
Don't lose sight of him.

00:55:54.034 --> 00:55:58.035
If you need anything, I've got his
bottle, diapers, favorite pacifier....

00:55:58.119 --> 00:56:00.251
Hurry up. Come on, come on.

00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:12.495
And now we are going to cut the glass
with my...

00:56:12.579 --> 00:56:17.538
Diapers? What?
Am I being taken by the nose sometimes?

00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:19.079
Motel la piñata!

00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:22.704
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys.

00:56:22.792 --> 00:56:25.744
Guys, where's that other bag
with my tools?

00:56:25.828 --> 00:56:27.164
In le balloon.

00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:29.204
Um...

00:56:29.288 --> 00:56:30.288
Oops.

00:56:32.748 --> 00:56:33.996
What, huh...

00:56:36.704 --> 00:56:38.873
Okay, let's see what I have here.

00:56:38.957 --> 00:56:40.205
Um...

00:56:40.293 --> 00:56:42.293
Come on, come on, come on.

00:56:42.373 --> 00:56:43.373
Aha!

00:56:49.749 --> 00:56:50.789
Hm, thank you.

00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.121
Apple egg.

00:57:08.665 --> 00:57:09.665
Huh?

00:57:14.002 --> 00:57:16.166
That's Mr. Friendly.

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.121
Stupid kids.

00:57:20.498 --> 00:57:22.206
No, no, no!

00:57:28.583 --> 00:57:30.207
I hate my job.

00:57:30.291 --> 00:57:31.291
Pfiew.

00:57:39.499 --> 00:57:40.751
Ha, ha, ha.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.539
Oh, that's Dr. Destructo.
Just a kid.

00:57:49.623 --> 00:57:52.332
There is the original helmet
of Killer Driller.

00:57:52.776 --> 00:57:54.540
Come on. Stay with it for a while.

00:58:03.916 --> 00:58:04.999
Diaper.

00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:07.251
Huppa.
-Yes.

00:58:19.877 --> 00:58:22.752
I have to have something that...
Something that I can...

00:58:22.836 --> 00:58:24.292
Like this?

00:58:24.776 --> 00:58:25.797
Nice.

00:58:28.793 --> 00:58:29.793
Yes!

00:58:34.342 --> 00:58:36.585
We're in.
-Wait.

00:58:36.669 --> 00:58:37.793
No, no, no.

00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:39.669
Baby powder.

00:58:39.753 --> 00:58:40.961
Yes, si, si, here.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.750
Wow.

00:58:47.834 --> 00:58:50.641
You know, the most important thing
in a squat

00:58:50.642 --> 00:58:53.758
is that you remain constantly aware
of possible danger.

00:58:54.754 --> 00:58:56.046
La, la tiramisu.

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:58.834
- Come here.
- Hey.

00:58:58.926 --> 00:59:01.501
Junior. Junior, come back here.

00:59:04.006 --> 00:59:07.842
And what are you up to now?
-I'm working on it.

00:59:11.842 --> 00:59:13.502
No, don't touch anything.

00:59:13.586 --> 00:59:16.003
No, no, no, no, no.

00:59:18.779 --> 00:59:21.295
Yes, well done, Junior. Good job.

00:59:25.003 --> 00:59:28.503
Oh, he's having fun.
-Yes, too much fun.

00:59:30.127 --> 00:59:31.756
Stop.

00:59:31.844 --> 00:59:35.672
Here you go, Junior.
Daddy needs to steal a honey badger.

00:59:38.756 --> 00:59:40.504
Okay.

00:59:41.628 --> 00:59:44.128
I know they keep Lenny
keep here at night.

00:59:44.928 --> 00:59:50.253
And if I'm not mistaken, there should be
a hidden switch somewhere.

00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:51.629
Aha.

00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:54.048
Yes.

00:59:57.221 --> 00:59:58.221
Ow.

01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:08.380
I'm going to give him this.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.980
When he is knocked out,
we open the cage.

01:00:11.049 --> 01:00:13.921
That downy devil
Sleeps like a baby as long as

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:21.638
Okay, he's still asleep.

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.714
Mama mia!

01:00:32.922 --> 01:00:34.722
Now my leg sleeps.

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.130
Hey! Hey!

01:00:45.555 --> 01:00:47.299
Gru, what should we do?

01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:48.967
No!

01:00:52.888 --> 01:00:55.839
Oh, no. I'm ruining our squat.

01:00:58.051 --> 01:00:58.883
What?

01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:00.632
Who will dare?

01:01:06.547 --> 01:01:07.883
Intruders.

01:01:10.783 --> 01:01:13.223
Intruders!

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.800
Wake up!

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:27.924
No!

01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:34.885
What?

01:01:37.885 --> 01:01:38.925
Hmm.

01:01:42.301 --> 01:01:43.593
Aw.

01:01:43.677 --> 01:01:45.053
Aw.

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:47.093
No. No.

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.258
Come on, we have to go.

01:01:55.762 --> 01:01:56.801
Ouch! Come on.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:02.342
Intruders,
you're bullying the wrong principal.

01:02:03.058 --> 01:02:05.050
Here we go, come on. Come on.

01:02:10.598 --> 01:02:12.013
Hup, hup, hup.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:17.594
Come on.

01:02:17.682 --> 01:02:19.970
Ugh, you won't get away with this!

01:02:42.851 --> 01:02:45.767
Prepare for the fury
of Überschlecht.

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.720
Ah, baby butt ointment.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.680
Oh no, oh no! Stop, stop, stop!

01:02:55.853 --> 01:02:57.145
Oh dear.

01:02:59.768 --> 01:03:03.761
Come back again, you. I want my Lenny!

01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:09.680
How can we get out of here?

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.013
Follow me.

01:03:11.845 --> 01:03:12.845
Get in.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.016
Come on, come on, come on!

01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:21.761
Mr. Friendly.

01:03:44.686 --> 01:03:50.514
I must say: that was without a doubt
the coolest night of my life.

01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:53.147
Unbelievable that we succeeded.

01:03:54.139 --> 01:03:57.939
I don't deny it, that was pretty fun.

01:04:00.187 --> 01:04:01.603
Thanks, Ron.

01:04:01.683 --> 01:04:02.975
Whew, o la la.

01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:06.895
And thank you, for everything.

01:04:07.847 --> 01:04:13.263
Oh, and hey, no worries.
Your secret is safe with me, partner.

01:04:13.355 --> 01:04:14.723
Thank you.

01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:16.871
Goodbye.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:22.103
Your daddy did quite nicely, didn't he Junior?

01:04:27.976 --> 01:04:29.892
Si, si, si, go, go.

01:04:30.763 --> 01:04:35.056
Oh hello, Maxime.
How is my favorite pupil doing?

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.100
I think you and I are looking
for the same person.

01:04:39.188 --> 01:04:42.933
And I know very precisely where he is.

01:04:50.185 --> 01:04:52.641
Thank you, director Überschlecht.

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:56.981
We got him.
Valentina, to Mayflower.

01:04:57.058 --> 01:04:58.518
My pleasure.

01:05:04.061 --> 01:05:04.893
Ah.

01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:06.310
Check it out.

01:05:07.562 --> 01:05:09.102
Okay, yes. Yes.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.310
It's all coming back.

01:05:13.394 --> 01:05:14.934
Oops.

01:05:15.018 --> 01:05:16.565
Okay.

01:05:16.566 --> 01:05:17.809
See you later.

01:05:18.565 --> 01:05:21.101
Say: Bye, Daddy and Mommy.
-Have fun!

01:05:21.185 --> 01:05:23.226
Take good care of yourself.

01:05:23.314 --> 01:05:25.394
Bye, huh!
-Bye.

01:05:26.274 --> 01:05:26.558
Bye!

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.311
Hey, Cunninghammetjes.
-Ehm, hey, Poppy.

01:05:30.795 --> 01:05:34.018
Our parents have a play date,
which is pretty cute.

01:05:34.102 --> 01:05:36.558
I thought you guys might want to
wanted to do?

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.687
Oh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

01:05:38.767 --> 01:05:41.519
The party can begin, folks.

01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:45.735
She's nice.
-Yes, everyone thinks so.

01:05:46.352 --> 01:05:47.520
Nice.

01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:50.727
And have you ever seen
seen a honey badger?

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.852
Wow.

01:05:57.944 --> 01:06:00.559
Okay, they don't make a mess of it.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.796
There are my favo new neighbors.

01:06:04.236 --> 01:06:04.312
Hi.

01:06:04.396 --> 01:06:09.776
Oh, what a cool vibe.
You guys look like a bunch of pros!

01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:13.353
Yes, but we are not.

01:06:13.877 --> 01:06:16.064
Perry and the boys are waiting for you
on the job.

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:18.312
We set out to find the clubhouse.

01:06:18.396 --> 01:06:22.152
And you tell me where you got
got that insane outfit.

01:06:27.777 --> 01:06:29.397
To this, Chet.

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:30.521
Hello.

01:06:31.065 --> 01:06:32.065
Okay.

01:06:33.569 --> 01:06:36.937
Flip, Jip, Chet. Chet, Flip, Jip.
-Hello boys.

01:06:37.021 --> 01:06:38.605
Hello.
-How are you, Chet?

01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:39.729
Okay.

01:06:41.153 --> 01:06:43.982
Chet here is going to show us
how to do it.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:46.146
Right?

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:48.898
Um... Hmm.

01:06:48.982 --> 01:06:52.230
I'll make that guy
complete in.

01:06:52.314 --> 01:06:53.730
Okay.

01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:04.731
So what?

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:14.155
Okay, here goes.

01:07:18.983 --> 01:07:21.694
Huh, you can't be serious.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.567
Okay, okay.

01:07:25.527 --> 01:07:26.607
Better?

01:07:32.276 --> 01:07:33.568
What!

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.816
Huh?

01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:36.231
That doesn't count.

01:07:36.315 --> 01:07:37.815
And... What?

01:07:37.903 --> 01:07:39.527
You can't just...

01:07:40.608 --> 01:07:42.528
This is ridiculous.

01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:44.524
Hey!

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.524
Thank you, Ron.

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:00.525
Hey, no!

01:08:03.233 --> 01:08:04.565
Come and get it.

01:08:04.657 --> 01:08:06.734
Aw, he's so cute.
-Wow.

01:08:06.822 --> 01:08:09.317
This is the funniest doggie of all time.

01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:11.741
I'll go.

01:08:21.802 --> 01:08:25.317
Oh hello, little girl. Is your daddy home?

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:29.109
Sorry, I'm not allowed
talking to strange people.

01:08:29.986 --> 01:08:34.818
I'm not a strange person.
-Well, you do look strange.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:35.902
O.

01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:37.318
Who is there?

01:08:37.803 --> 01:08:43.150
I don't know.
But she's old and smells like brussels sprouts.

01:08:46.659 --> 01:08:48.195
Okay, I'm coming already.

01:08:52.803 --> 01:08:53.803
Oh no. Um...

01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:55.783
I'll be right back.

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.027
Is there anything I can do for you?
-Well, I hope so.

01:09:01.115 --> 01:09:03.112
I am a friend of Gru's.

01:09:03.612 --> 01:09:05.028
Well...

01:09:05.112 --> 01:09:07.196
There isn't, so...

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.275
Oh, never mind, you know.

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:12.284
I'll wait.

01:09:15.072 --> 01:09:16.780
Huh? What? No, ouch!

01:09:18.244 --> 01:09:20.745
Tell me when you're ready.

01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:21.821
Huh?

01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:23.821
Hm?

01:09:28.244 --> 01:09:30.696
...so instead
it became Maui.

01:09:30.784 --> 01:09:36.568
So you understand, Perry and I are no longer
no longer welcome on the island of Oahu.

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:37.737
Honestly.

01:09:38.613 --> 01:09:40.404
- Honey...
- Oh, happy.

01:09:41.244 --> 01:09:42.824
The children. We have to leave. Now.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:47.153
Thank you. Bye.

01:09:47.245 --> 01:09:48.945
We were discovered.
-What?

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:50.993
Call Silas.
-O no.

01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:05.406
Oe, bella.

01:10:11.238 --> 01:10:12.406
Nope.

01:10:13.246 --> 01:10:14.282
Bazooka!

01:10:27.198 --> 01:10:28.862
Gru is in danger.

01:10:28.954 --> 01:10:33.031
We have an emergency, folks.
My retirement is officially over.

01:10:33.115 --> 01:10:35.531
Collect the Mega Minions.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.363
Huh, Pomodoro!

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.740
Huh?

01:10:53.824 --> 01:10:56.156
Ha. Pomodoro!

01:11:07.993 --> 01:11:08.993
Hey.

01:11:10.117 --> 01:11:12.077
Bello, busy bee.

01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:14.576
Aw.

01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:15.577
Huh?

01:11:16.249 --> 01:11:17.617
Pomodoro!

01:11:21.618 --> 01:11:22.866
Yeehaa!

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.950
Huh?

01:11:24.786 --> 01:11:25.910
Pomodoro!

01:11:28.365 --> 01:11:30.865
Pomodoro! Yiehaa!

01:11:30.949 --> 01:11:32.785
Yippa, yippa!

01:11:35.577 --> 01:11:36.577
Huh?

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:37.870
Wow!

01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:39.618
Yeah!

01:11:40.618 --> 01:11:41.950
Huh, O...

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:50.537
Well...

01:11:50.538 --> 01:11:53.202
Your father has been naughty.

01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:55.619
Incredibly naughty.

01:11:56.811 --> 01:11:59.826
He stole something
That I would like to get back.

01:12:04.703 --> 01:12:06.203
Director Überschlecht?

01:12:06.995 --> 01:12:07.867
O.

01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:11.535
I know you have my Lenny.
So give it back.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:12.535
Ouch, ouch!

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:15.995
That's actually a very funny story.
-Cup close.

01:12:16.075 --> 01:12:18.952
I don't want to hear excuses.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:20.784
Come on, tough guy.

01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:23.744
Okay, I'm really not
fight with an old lady.

01:12:23.828 --> 01:12:24.952
Oh no?

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.413
Well, I'll kick your ass
that you'll remember for a long time.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:31.412
What?

01:12:32.123 --> 01:12:33.659
Address.

01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:38.828
Yeah, go!

01:12:39.832 --> 01:12:43.833
Girls, watch out. Over here.
Stay low all of you!

01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:47.579
Hey. Stop it, lady.

01:12:56.537 --> 01:12:58.581
Ah, girls!

01:12:58.669 --> 01:13:01.576
Stop it!
-Let go of him.

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:02.625
Take it!

01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:08.082
Take it!

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:14.537
Now we're going to go in there
And look for that baby.

01:13:14.538 --> 01:13:15.707
What?

01:13:19.286 --> 01:13:23.747
Oh, jackpot, huh.
-Maxime, this is too easy.

01:13:25.255 --> 01:13:26.679
Come on, little bébé.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.955
Join Maxime.

01:13:28.039 --> 01:13:30.039
Yes, koetsjie, koetsjie....

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:31.871
Ai, Maxime...

01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:33.247
You little brat...

01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:36.078
Things are swinging for you, little man.

01:13:37.086 --> 01:13:38.294
Got it.

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.371
Yes!

01:13:43.415 --> 01:13:44.415
What?

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:54.079
Wait. Where's the baby? Where's the baby!

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.207
Junior?

01:13:58.836 --> 01:14:00.296
Lucy!

01:14:00.372 --> 01:14:02.815
Go get the baby!

01:14:05.296 --> 01:14:05.580
Maxime.

01:14:05.672 --> 01:14:07.543
Say au revoir, Gru.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:12.248
Oh, and don't worry, because he's going to be
very happy with his new daddy.

01:14:12.336 --> 01:14:15.541
Look at him.
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:17.041
Junior!

01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:25.921
Get in.

01:14:26.965 --> 01:14:28.749
We have to deliver a baby.

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:37.960
We got him.

01:14:38.036 --> 01:14:39.459
O.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.832
Who is going to be a cockroach?

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:42.744
Ouch!

01:14:42.832 --> 01:14:46.165
Let go. Those are very sensitive.

01:14:46.253 --> 01:14:47.665
You wriggling worm....

01:14:47.745 --> 01:14:48.745
Oh.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.496
Iew.

01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:54.452
You don't mean that.
You're piping all over my cockpit.

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:59.749
Valentina, bring me
the cockroach ray.

01:15:02.878 --> 01:15:04.693
There they are.

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.709
I go off on it.

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:10.418
Here we go.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.831
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:27.127
What is that?

01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:29.415
Hello.

01:15:29.499 --> 01:15:31.247
Ah, Gru.

01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:33.171
A little closer.

01:15:35.755 --> 01:15:37.211
Yes, almost.

01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:40.834
Turn them off.

01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:53.835
You're doing a great job.

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.920
Put it on, partner.

01:16:17.881 --> 01:16:19.921
Hey, I don't see anything.

01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:36.462
Junior.

01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:41.797
Don't worry, Gru. The baby's okay.

01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:43.505
See for yourself.

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:47.958
Oh, Junior.

01:16:48.046 --> 01:16:53.005
And so now he belongs to me.
Isn't that so, Maxime Junior?

01:16:53.753 --> 01:16:59.466
Together we are going to make mischief, mess
kicking. And have so much fun with it.

01:17:01.046 --> 01:17:04.923
And the best part is: He hates you.
He really does.

01:17:05.007 --> 01:17:07.091
Release my son.

01:17:07.175 --> 01:17:11.130
No, I didn't think so.
The fun is really just getting started now.

01:17:21.672 --> 01:17:24.631
Look what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:40.004
Huh?

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.548
You're going too far, Maxime.
So give me my son.

01:17:55.632 --> 01:17:58.756
That's what I said, right? He's my son now.

01:17:58.836 --> 01:18:00.752
Huh? Huh...

01:18:03.589 --> 01:18:04.589
Ow.

01:18:10.257 --> 01:18:15.965
Watch your step, Gru. It's a
thingy. Now if only you could fly, huh?

01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:24.510
Release.

01:18:35.803 --> 01:18:37.967
This ends now.

01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:40.470
Say goodbye to Daddy.

01:18:43.663 --> 01:18:44.663
O.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:50.178
It's okay, Junior. Daddy loves you.

01:19:15.012 --> 01:19:17.096
Come back, you. Bad baby.

01:19:17.172 --> 01:19:18.508
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:19:18.596 --> 01:19:20.428
Get off me, brat.

01:19:21.096 --> 01:19:23.096
Meet the fury of the...

01:19:23.173 --> 01:19:24.173
Hi-yah!

01:19:46.221 --> 01:19:48.846
See? Not a scratch.

01:19:48.926 --> 01:19:50.593
Huh, what?

01:19:50.673 --> 01:19:53.424
Salami!

01:19:55.425 --> 01:19:57.466
Pastrami!

01:19:58.673 --> 01:20:00.425
Non, non, non, non.

01:20:00.509 --> 01:20:01.881
Prosciutto!

01:20:04.134 --> 01:20:06.510
What?
Prosciutto!

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:08.266
Ow, ow, ow. nasty.

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.465
Nice try. If I...

01:20:17.634 --> 01:20:19.426
Antipasti.

01:20:27.307 --> 01:20:29.723
Gru.
-Junior.

01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:35.467
Yes!

01:20:35.555 --> 01:20:38.467
Unbelievable.
-Are you guys okay?

01:20:43.516 --> 01:20:45.140
Dad.

01:20:48.968 --> 01:20:50.512
Aw.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:51.636
O.

01:20:51.724 --> 01:20:53.140
My boys.

01:20:54.184 --> 01:21:00.515
You know? Today was just
a huge roller coaster of feelings.

01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:05.304
Um, Gru?

01:21:06.148 --> 01:21:07.600
May we go back home now?

01:21:12.265 --> 01:21:14.709
Okay, look at this.

01:21:15.096 --> 01:21:16.220
Yay.

01:21:16.308 --> 01:21:19.849
Thank you, Dr. Nefario.
As good as new.

01:21:19.977 --> 01:21:23.101
No job too small, or too crazy.

01:21:24.101 --> 01:21:26.310
Day day.
-Day.

01:21:34.514 --> 01:21:35.514
Hey.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.186
Are you okay, honey?

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:42.151
Agnes, there is someone here for you.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:50.935
Guitje?

01:21:55.226 --> 01:21:56.266
Guitje.

01:21:59.559 --> 01:22:01.766
Have you been practicing your tricks?

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.058
Okay, lying dead.

01:22:09.099 --> 01:22:10.431
Yes!

01:22:10.519 --> 01:22:14.896
That was...kind of scary.
-Yes. Kind of was.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:17.671
Guitje.

01:22:17.887 --> 01:22:19.139
Hey, I um...

01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:21.771
Be right back.
-O. Okay.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.020
I need to take care of something.
-Yes.

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.896
See you later, buddy.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.188
Love you, honey.

01:22:34.808 --> 01:22:35.848
O.

01:22:35.936 --> 01:22:38.144
How are you doing, Maxime?

01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:42.229
What do you come here for anyway, Gru?
Make fun of me? Well?

01:22:42.313 --> 01:22:46.185
Laugh? No, no, no, I just need
just need to get something off my chest.

01:22:46.269 --> 01:22:50.185
And it's about the talent show
from the third grade.

01:22:50.937 --> 01:22:54.476
Look ... Honestly ...

01:22:54.477 --> 01:22:57.853
I had stolen your song.
-What?

01:22:57.937 --> 01:23:02.229
I knew it. I knew it
wasn't a coincidence. Sneaky liar.

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.977
And?
-And what?

01:23:06.061 --> 01:23:08.105
And where are your excuses?

01:23:08.185 --> 01:23:11.269
What will we experience now?
I just gave that one.

01:23:11.713 --> 01:23:16.562
Oh, non, non, non. Those were not excuses.
You just wanted to rub it in.

01:23:16.646 --> 01:23:19.561
Unbelievable. You picked my song.

01:23:19.645 --> 01:23:24.686
I did that to get back at you because
you pulled down my pants at the gala.

01:23:24.774 --> 01:23:30.271
And by the way, you could have gone up after me.
It's not my fault you were scared.

01:23:30.715 --> 01:23:33.478
You were afraid because I was a topper.

01:23:33.479 --> 01:23:39.107
Me afraid? I'll sing you out whenever you want
And with two fingers in your nose.

01:23:40.063 --> 01:23:41.687
I would still like to see that.

01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:45.900
Wherever, whenever.
Speak up, mon ami.

01:23:56.604 --> 01:23:58.520
Oh yes.

01:24:10.816 --> 01:24:11.856
Come on.

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:28.437
Yes!

01:24:37.893 --> 01:24:39.313
Oh, yeah.

01:24:42.234 --> 01:24:43.858
Come on, rock.

01:26:09.316 --> 01:26:10.680
Oh yes!

01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:19.081
Bello?

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:21.774
Bello?

01:26:43.942 --> 01:26:44.983
Um...

01:26:49.735 --> 01:26:52.067
Oh, strudel.

01:28:01.574 --> 01:28:04.282
Hoppa. Hoppa.

01:28:05.305 --> 01:29:05.925
