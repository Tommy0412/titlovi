Referee,<br>why don't you stop the fight?

Let's go! Let's go!

4
00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:31.048
Come on! Get him!

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.719
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:01.204
You're waltzing.<br>Give the sucker some action.

7
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.665
You're fighting like a bum.<br>Want some advice?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.875
Water.

9
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.877
Cold beer here!

10
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.507
Should I bet the fight don't go<br>three rounds? You feel strong?

11
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.051
- Absolutely.<br>- Cold beer!

12
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.054
- You want good advice?<br>- Mouthpiece.

13
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.817
Come on, Rock!

14
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.929
All right. All right.

15
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:46.976
Next a six-rounder<br>between local lightweights Kid Brooks

16
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.811

17
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.696
Good going, champ.

18
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.116
- Hey.<br>- Say what?

19
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.328
- You got a smoke?<br>- Yeah, you can have this one.

20
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.705
You're a bum.

21
00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:11.000
You're a bum, you know that?<br>You're a bum!

22
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.864
You really got lucky tonight.

Give me a call. The doctor should be in<br>in about 20 minutes.

33
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.265
Hey, boy.

34
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.573
You guys are getting better every year.

35
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.325
Yeah.

36
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.400
Hey, your old man did pretty good tonight.

37
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.318
Why weren't you there?

38
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.113
You should've seen me. You guys hungry?

39
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:15.619
Here you go.

40
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.916
You wanna see<br>your friend Moby Dick, huh?

41
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.131
How you doing, Moby Dick?<br>You miss me today?

42
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.428
Here you go. Say hi.

43
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.182
If you guys could sing or dance,<br>I wouldn't be doing this.

44
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.368
And this turtle food I got here, it's...

45
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.705
This turtle food I got here<br>has more flies in it...

46
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.707
There are more moths in it than flies.

47
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.960
More flies... More moths...<br>Who the hell cares?

48
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.419
How you feeling this morning? Full of life?

49
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.878
Fine.

50
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.880
How you doing, killer?

51
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.925
- How's the turtle food this week?<br>- Fine.

52
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.636
I'm kind of aggravated.

53
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:38.971
Oh, I'm sorry.

54
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.640
Ain't your fault.<br>You don't wanna hear about it?

55
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.517
I'll tell you somebody<br>who don't wanna hear about it.

56
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.602
- How you doing, Gloria?<br>- Good.

57
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:49.815
The last turtle food I got here<br>had more moths in it than flies, Adrian.

58
00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.692
These moths get caught<br>in the turtle's throat

59
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.778
and they cough, and I gotta smack them<br>on the back of the shell

60
00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.739
and what do you think they get?

61
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.365
They get what?

62
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.703
Come on. Shell shock.

63
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.747
They get shell-shocked.<br>What do you think?

64
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.874
You're starting with<br>the bad jokes early, huh?

65
00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.501
Well, no.<br>Inventing jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

66
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.503
No, that wasn't no joke.

67
00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.715
Hey, how's my buddy doing today?<br>Yo, Butkus.

68
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.425
Yo, Butkus!

69
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.886
What is it?

70
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.017
Hey, give me a kiss.

71
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.229
Adrian, go downstairs and clean<br>all the cat cages. They're a mess.

72
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.372
You gotta pay for that turtle food,<br>rock head.

73
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.708
Hey, crime don't pay.<br>You know that, Gloria.

74
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.652
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?<br>- Real good.

75
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.695
Hey, Rock, you fighting again?

76
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.739
- Here and there.<br>- We'll make some money real soon, huh?

77
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.825
Yeah, a million dollars.

78
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.661
Hey, you. Where are you going?

79
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.710
Where are you going? Where you running?

80
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.296
- Where you running?<br>- Hey! Hey!

81
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.924
- Hey! Don't hit the face!<br>- Shut up!

82
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.343
- Not the face!<br>- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

83
00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:42.636
I'm broke!

84
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.889
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200<br>or break your thumb. You understand?

85
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.809
- Please, don't...<br>- What's your name again?

86
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.646
- Bob!<br>- Bob. Listen, Bob.

87
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.358
You wanna dance, you gotta pay the band.<br>You understand?

88
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.694
You wanna borrow,<br>you gotta pay the man.

89
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.114
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.<br>You understand?

90
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.867
Give me some money.<br>Give me some money.

91
00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.081
There's 130 here.

92
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.125
That's it. I'm broke.

93
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.628
Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.

94
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.048
You don't have to break nothing.<br>Take my coat.

95
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.217
It's worth $50, $60.

96
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.303
Take the coat!

97
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.389
You know, you should've planned ahead.

98
00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.600
You know that?<br>You should've planned ahead.

99
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.977
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand<br>like you broke the thumb!

100
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.646
- Should've planned ahead.<br>- Gazzo don't have to know!

101
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.816
He won't be wise to nothing!<br>Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!

102
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.694
Keep the coat! Keep the...

103
00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:13.852
He only had 130, but I think he's good<br>for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

104
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.271
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

105
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.274
That's it for today.

106
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.654
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.<br>He's late three weeks. I don't like it.

107
00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.073
Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?

108
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.700
All right, I got it.<br>How do you spell Del Rio?

109
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.078
- How'd you do last night?<br>- I did real good.

110
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.579
- Hey.<br>- What?

111
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.499
- Did you get the license number?<br>- Of what?

112
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.417
The truck that run over your face.

113
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.586
Relax, Buddy. Pull it over here.

114
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:43.131
I wanna let Rocky out.<br>I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

115
00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.864
Why didn't you break this guy's thumb?

116
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.242
- How do you know I didn't?<br>- You don't think I hear things?

117
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.119
Didn't I give you a job this morning?

118
00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.080
- Yeah.<br>- Why didn't you break his thumb?

119
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:19.001
When you don't do what I tell you to do,<br>you make me look bad.

120
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.087
I figured... Look.<br>I figured if I break the guy's thumb,

121
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.547
he gets laid off.

122
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.508
- He can't make money.<br>- Let me do the figuring.

123
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.969
From here on in, let me do the figuring.

124
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:33.098
These guys think we're running a charity,<br>they'll get off light.

125
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.684
From here on in, do what I tell you to do,

126
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.269
because it's bad for my reputation.

127
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:40.105
You understand? You got it, Rock?

128
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.441
I got it.

129
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.321
How do you spell Del Rio?

130
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.115
- Look it up in a dictionary.<br>- Come on!

131
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.410
I won't let that happen no more,<br>about the thumb.

132
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.580
You know?

133
00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.416
So long, meat bag.

134
00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.546
I should've broke your thumbs!

135
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.328
Hey, Rock. Heard you did good last night.

136
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.456
- Absolutely. Should've seen me.<br>- Shouldn't you take a rest?

137
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.416
- No, my back is hurt.<br>- Your back?

138
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.585
My back is hurt. You deaf?

139
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.212
No, I'm short.

140
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.361
Hey, yo, Mike.

141
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.406
Where's my lock?<br>Whose stuff is this in my locker?

142
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.701
It's Dipper's stuff.<br>It ain't your locker no more.

143
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.914
What you talking about?<br>It's been my locker for six years.

144
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.416
Where's my gear?

145
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.127
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

146
00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.967
You put my stuff on skid row.

147
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:18.096
I been in that locker for six years,<br>and you put my stuff on skid row?

148
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.599
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

149
00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.100
Where is he?

150
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.644
He's outside working with Dipper.

151
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.105
- He's in a bad mood.<br>- So am I.

152
00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.950
Keep your hands up.

153
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.828
Keep your hands up. Watch the right.

154
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.580
- Hey, Mick.<br>- Shut up!

155
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.832
To the body. Attaboy.

156
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.962
Time. Time!

157
00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.591
What do you want?

158
00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.010
- How you feeling today?<br>- What?

159
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.137
- How you feeling?<br>- Are you a doctor?

160
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:02.224
- You have problems today?<br>- Never mind. What's your problem?

161
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:06.311
I been talking to Michael.<br>How come I been put out of my locker?

162
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.773
Because Dipper needed it.<br>Dipper's a contender.

163
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.067
He's a climber.<br>Do you know what you are?

164
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.444
- You're a tomato.<br>- Tomato?

165
00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.656
I run a business here,<br>not a goddamn soup kitchen.

166
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.741
- Did you fight last night?<br>- Yeah.

167
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.828
- Did you win?<br>- Yeah, I won K.O. In the second.

168
00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.621
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

169
00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.122
Spider Rico.

170
00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:27.874
He's a bum!

171
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:32.045
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.<br>- Well, ain't they?

172
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.257
You got heart,<br>but you fight like a goddamn ape.

173
00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.552
The only thing special about you,<br>you never got your nose busted.

174
00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:42.347
Leave it that way. Nice and pretty<br>and what's left of your mind.

175
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.141
I think I'm gonna go take a steam.<br>You know why?

176
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.894
Because I did good last night,<br>and you should've seen me.

177
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.522
- Big deal.<br>- You should've seen me too.

178
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.898
Hey, kid.

179
00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:54.818
- You ever think about retiring?<br>- No.

180
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.570
- You think about it.<br>- Yeah.

181
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.238
All right, time.

182
00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.906
- Time!<br>- What?

183
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.117
I dig your locker, man.

184
00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.580
Dig your locker.

185
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.958
Attaboy.

186
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:42.198
Cold night.

187
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.202
Whew! Good night to catch pneumonia,<br>you know?

188
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.000
You need some help?

189
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.712
There's a good game<br>at the Spectrum tonight.

190
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.675
You wanna go to a basketball game?

191
00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.597
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

192
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.102
Tough day today.<br>They took my locker away.

193
00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.022
I had that locker for six years.<br>It don't bother me.

194
00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.649
Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.

195
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:16.983
People get the combination.

196
00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.946
I must've had 20 bucks<br>taken out of there in the past 6 years.

197
00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:24.074
Don't sound like much, but it adds up.

198
00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:26.201
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

199
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.413
Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

200
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:33.166
Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.

201
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.834
The giant worm.

202
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:40.215
Look at these birds.<br>Don't these birds look like flying candy?

203
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.133
Bird, you wanna fly me home?

204
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.719
You need somebody to walk you home?

205
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.137
- No.<br>- No?

206
00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:50.767
It's a cold night.<br>If you got the money, take a cab.

207
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:53.019
Too many creeps around here.

208
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:56.147
Every other block, there's a creep.

209
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.650
You can always tell a creep.

210
00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:02.529
Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?

211
00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:04.322
I'll see you later, all right?

212
00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:08.201
None of you guys get up.<br>I know you had a hard day in the cage.

213
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.369
So,

214
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.497
I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.<br>I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.

215
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:14.332
Okay? Good night, Adrian.

216
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.126
Good night, Rocky.

217
00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:37.230
Don't know what happened.

218
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:41.401
Hey, there, Lefty. Got a friend for you here.

219
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.695
- Hello, Rock.<br>- How you doing?

220
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.989
- You seen Paulie?<br>- Yeah, he's in the steam room.

221
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.908
- Yeah.<br>- Hey, Rocky. What's with the eye?

222
00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.952
- Been fighting.<br>- Hope you won it, at least.

223
00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.871
Oh, yeah, did real good.<br>You should've seen me.

224
00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:54.164
...heavyweight champion of the world

225
00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:55.915
Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...

226
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.126
Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?

227
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.627
Spider Rico.

228
00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:01.963
Jesus. Is he still around?

229
00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:05.216
Yeah, he's doing real good.<br>He's doing better than you are.

230
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:08.970
Hey, Paulie. What, do you lock the door?<br>Yo, Paulie.

231
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.057
I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br>who broke the mirror.

232
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:13.808
Hey, yo, Paulie.

233
00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:18.897
Every day, every night, I pass by.<br>Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

234
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.648
- Forget her.<br>- What do you mean?

235
00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.734
- You can do better than her.<br>- I don't forget nothing.

236
00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.861
Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.

237
00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.572
Every morning I pass by, I tell a joke.

238
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.741
She just looks at me,<br>you know what I mean?

239
00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:32.744
- Looks?<br>- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

240
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.579
I need a Cadillac<br>to connect with your sister?

241
00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.956
Something wrong with my face?

242
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.584
She's a freaking loser.

243
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.921
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,<br>I could split her head with a razor.

244
00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.924
- Don't get mental.<br>- You caught me in a bad mood.

245
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.843
- You're always in a bad mood.<br>- Adrian ain't sharp.

246
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.804
Adrian is a loser.

247
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.264
She's pushing 30 freaking years old.

248
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:55.683
If she don't watch out,<br>she's gonna die alone.

249
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:58.394
- I'm 30 myself.<br>- And you'll die alone.

250
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.438
I don't see no crowd around you neither.

251
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.774
I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br>who broke the mirror.

252
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.527
Come on. Let's get out of this stink.

253
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:09.239
- I wanna talk to you anyway.<br>- About what?

254
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:11.741
- You still work for Gazzo?<br>- Yeah, sure.

255
00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:14.369
Why don't you talk to him about me?

256
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:17.539
I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.

257
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:20.208
You know? Come on.

258
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.506
- The girl's dried up.<br>- Who?

259
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.176
My sister. If she don't start living,<br>her body's gonna dry up.

260
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:32.637
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?

261
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.598
- Come over and talk to her.<br>- Sure. Beer.

262
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:37.976
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?

263
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.311
Absolutely. You got it.

264
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.773
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br>she calls the hospital.

265
00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:45.150
- Paulie!<br>- I got it.

266
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:46.860
...Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green

267
00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:49.821
here in Philadelphia<br>at the fabulous Spectrum.

268
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.072
Larry.

269
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:53.616
You're speaking now of your<br>much-publicized Bicentennial fight.

270
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.911
Right. This is gonna be the greatest<br>sporting event in the country's history.

271
00:24:56.996 --> 00:25:00.123
A gala occurrence with me beating Green<br>like he committed a crime.

272
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.792
Would you take a look at that guy?

273
00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:06.045
I mean, where are the real fighters<br>gonna come from? The pros.

274
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.506
All we got today are jig clowns.

275
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.967
...on January 1st.<br>The first major event in the country's...

276
00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:13.219
- Clown?<br>- That's right, clown.

277
00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:16.723
And in keeping with great events<br>throughout the country's history,

278
00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:20.810
Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking<br>of the Liberty Bell by cracking Green.

279
00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:23.396
You're calling Apollo Creed a clown?

280
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.440
What else? Look at him.

281
00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:27.859
Stay in school and use your brain.

282
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:30.904
Be a doctor, be a lawyer,<br>carry a leather briefcase.

283
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:34.490
Forget about sports as a profession.<br>Sports make you grunt and smell.

284
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:38.203
- Be a thinker, not a stinker.<br>- Thanks a lot, champ.

285
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.496
You crazy?<br>This man is champion of the world.

286
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.291
He took his best shot and become champ.

287
00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:45.919
What shot did you ever take?

288
00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:49.214
Hey, Rocky,<br>you're not happy with your life, that's nice.

289
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:52.592
But me, I got a business going.<br>I don't have to take no shots.

290
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.677
No one having gone<br>more than 12 rounds with him...

291
00:25:54.762 --> 00:25:57.472
- That's right.<br>...and that was Jake Dale last June...

292
00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:01.309
- Stick that up your business.<br>- Why you getting so insulted?

293
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.479
You want me to take a shot? All right.

294
00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:06.272
I'll take a shot.

295
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.372
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?<br>- No wine, man.

296
00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:25.625
- Come on. Just a little.<br>- Buy us some Thunderbird.

297
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.295
Marie, does your brother know<br>you're hanging out so late?

298
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.547
- Get lost, creep.<br>- Screw you, yo-yo!

299
00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.675
These guys teach you to talk like that?

300
00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.636
- Stuff it!<br>- Don't you never say that to me.

301
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.847
You stink up the neighborhood!

302
00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.309
You know, you can...

303
00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:47.647
When I was your age, only one girl in<br>the whole neighborhood talked like that.

304
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.649
That was it. Just one.

305
00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:52.902
What are you doing?<br>It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

306
00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:54.279
I like yellow teeth!

307
00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.739
- It'll make your breath like garbage.<br>- Maybe I like garbage.

308
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.658
Nobody likes garbage.

309
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:01.536
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth<br>wasn't bad looking,

310
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.122
but none of the guys ever took her serious.

311
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.040
They never took her out<br>for any serious date.

312
00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.667
- Why?<br>- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

313
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.794
They laugh when you talk dirty.<br>They think you're cute.

314
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:12.547
After a while, you get a reputation.<br>You get no respect.

315
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.966
You understand? You get no respect.

316
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.760
I gotta use a bad word, whore.

317
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:19.762
You understand? Whore.

318
00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:23.850
See? You use dirty words,<br>and maybe you end up becoming a whore.

319
00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:25.810
Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.

320
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.271
That don't matter.

321
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:31.441
You don't really have to be one.<br>Just act like one and that's it.

322
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:35.236
Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.<br>You understand?

323
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:38.823
Twenty years from now,<br>people are gonna say,

324
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.242
"Do you remember Marie?"<br>"No. Who was she?"

325
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:43.911
"She was the little whore who hung down<br>at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

326
00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.289
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

327
00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:49.876
You see, they don't remember you.<br>They remember the rep.

328
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.544
You understand?

329
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:55.798
You got a boyfriend?<br>No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

330
00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.926
You know why?<br>Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?

331
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:01.804
'Cause you're hanging out with them<br>coconuts on the corner.

332
00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.681
You hang around coconuts,<br>you get nowhere.

333
00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:05.516
They're lemons. Lemons.

334
00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:08.644
You hang out with nice people,<br>you get nice friends. You understand?

335
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.189
You hang out with smart people,<br>you get smart friends.

336
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:13.816
You hang out with yo-yo people,<br>you get yo-yo friends.

337
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:16.319
You see, it's simple mathematics.

338
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:18.654
- I hope you ain't...<br>- I won't.

339
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:19.822
What was I gonna say?

340
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:22.950
You hope I don't keep acting<br>like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?

341
00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:24.118
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.328
Good night, Rocky.

343
00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:27.705
- Good night. Take care.<br>- Hey, Rocky.

344
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.458
- Yo.<br>- Screw you, creep-o!

345
00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:41.135
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?

346
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.637
Who are you?

347
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.700
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br>- Definitely.

348
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.828
Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered

349
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:10.456
"a severely cracked third metacarpal<br>in his left hand."

350
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.291
Damn!

351
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:16.421
We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br>if you're set on fighting Green.

352
00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:18.548
Hey, it ain't just Green.

353
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:21.175
What about all the time<br>Apollo has invested?

354
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.927
We can find a solution.

355
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.095
Solution nothing.

356
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:26.889
Find me another ranked contender<br>in a flash, Jergens.

357
00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:28.933
Don't play games with my client.

358
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.602
Apollo's already done a million dollars'<br>worth of publicity,

359
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.605
has made contractual obligations<br>with 20 different organizations.

360
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.399
He's not going to be embarrassed!

361
00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:38.860
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

362
00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:40.903
Ernie's fighting in France that same week.

363
00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:43.114
Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br>He's ranked fifth.

364
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.033
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.

365
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.494
I called every<br>worthwhile contender.

366
00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:52.540
They all say five weeks isn't enough time<br>to get into shape.

367
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.168
Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.

368
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.253
They know everybody<br>is gonna see this fight.

369
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:59.130
None of them's got<br>a prayer of whipping me.

370
00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:03.259
They're making excuses so they don't<br>have to be the chump who gets whipped.

371
00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:05.970
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

372
00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:09.640
I've promoted fights<br>in every goddamn country in the world

373
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.893
and I've broken my ass over this one.

374
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.228
I don't know what else to do!

375
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:20.943
I do.

376
00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:27.241
Without a ranked contender,<br>what this fight needs is a novelty.

377
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.161
This is the land of opportunity, right?

378
00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:32.663
So, Apollo Creed, on January 1 st,

379
00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:35.833
gives a local underdog fighter<br>an opportunity.

380
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:40.838
A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br>put his face on this poster with me.

381
00:30:40.923 --> 00:30:42.840
And I'll tell you why.

382
00:30:42.925 --> 00:30:44.926
Because I'm sentimental.

383
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.970
A lot of other people in this country<br>are just as sentimental

384
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.848
and there's nothing they'd like better<br>than to see Apollo Creed

385
00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:54.060
give a local Philadelphia boy<br>a shot at the greatest title in the world

386
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:56.479
on this country's biggest birthday.

387
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:58.689
Now that's the way I see it

388
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:01.234
and that's the way it's gonna be.

389
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.027
Apollo, I like it.

390
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:05.279
It's very American.

391
00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:08.950
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

392
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.685
- What is it?<br>- I wanna check this thing out.

393
00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:39.564
You said pick up two yards from Snyder<br>and a grand from Cappoli, right?

394
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:43.734
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br>and a grand from Snyder.

395
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:45.570
- Two yards.<br>- Write it down, okay?

396
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:47.238
Yeah, I got it.

397
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.700
Who's this girl you're going out with<br>tomorrow night?

398
00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:53.035
- How'd you know?<br>- I know.

399
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.247
Don't you think I hear things?<br>Lot of canaries flying around the docks.

400
00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:58.583
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br>- Hey, Rocky.

401
00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:00.835
- What?<br>- I hear she's retarded.

402
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.087
She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

403
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:07.758
Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br>I hear retards like the zoo.

404
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.677
- This bum gotta say that?<br>- Who you calling a bum?

405
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.554
- Back it up, Buddy.<br>- I'm calling you a bum!

406
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:14.932
Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.<br>It's his prostate.

407
00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:18.102
He's always in a bad mood.<br>You ought to count your blessings.

408
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.854
You're still a healthy person.

409
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.148
- I don't like your face.<br>- I don't like yours either!

410
00:32:22.232 --> 00:32:24.275
- Kiss my ass!<br>- Come out here!

411
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.902
Relax! Relax. My ears.

412
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:29.655
Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.

413
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:32.408
Look. Buddy doesn't like you.

414
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.786
Some guys, they just hate for no reason.<br>Capisce?

415
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:37.538
- Yeah.<br>- Come here.

416
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:42.335
Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,<br>you have a nice time.

417
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:43.669
Thanks.

418
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.881
How'd you know her name?

419
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.216
You don't think I hear things?

420
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.302
- Hey, Rock.<br>- What?

421
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.845
- Remember what I told you?<br>- What'd you tell me?

422
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:53.929
Take her to the zoo.

423
00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:55.973
Come on out of the car!

424
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:05.733
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br>- No, thanks, Shirley.

425
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.194
What do you think about Billy Snow?

426
00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:09.487
Fouls.

427
00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:12.823
How about Big Chuck Smith?

428
00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:14.992
No, he's too old and dull.

429
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.036
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

430
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.829
No. I don't feel no heat from that name.

431
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:21.082
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

432
00:33:22.292 --> 00:33:25.127
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?

433
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.464
This is what I'm looking for.

434
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.758
The Italian Stallion.

435
00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:33.594
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

436
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:36.055
Look, it's the name, man.

437
00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:38.140
The Italian Stallion.

438
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:40.726
The media will eat it up.

439
00:33:40.811 --> 00:33:43.646
Who discovered America?<br>An Italian, right?

440
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.483
What would be better than to get it on<br>with one of his descendants?

441
00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.026
He's a southpaw.

442
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:50.861
I don't want you messing around<br>with southpaws.

443
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.988
- They do everything backwards.<br>- Southpaw nothing.

444
00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:54.990
I'll drop him in three.

445
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.870
Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.

446
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.791
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

447
00:34:04.126 --> 00:34:06.085
What are you doing with that bat?

448
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:07.837
I used to be deadly at stickball.

449
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.798
- Your sister knows I'm coming?<br>- She's very excited.

450
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:13.217
- Look at these swollen hands.<br>- Yeah.

451
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:16.721
The joints from carrying meat<br>in and out of the freezer.

452
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:20.057
- Plays hell on the joints.<br>- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

453
00:34:20.142 --> 00:34:22.059
I don't need a doctor.<br>I need a different job.

454
00:34:22.144 --> 00:34:24.562
Different job. What kind of turkey?<br>Big? Small?

455
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:27.982
Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.

456
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.110
Nothing bothers me.<br>I'd make a great collector.

457
00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:33.195
Busting bones don't bother me.

458
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.656
Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?

459
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:38.743
Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.<br>It's a bad job.

460
00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.369
You got a match?

461
00:34:40.454 --> 00:34:42.413
Go to him for me. As a favor.

462
00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:45.249
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey

463
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:48.794
was when they had a two-dollar special<br>at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.

464
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.380
Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.

465
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:03.601
- Your sister knows I'm coming?<br>- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

466
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.356
Will you forget about Gazzo?

467
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.484
I don't ask nobody twice.

468
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:13.527
Don't ask nobody twice.

469
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.951
You're sure your sister knows I'm coming?

470
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.078
Yeah. She's very excited.

471
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.542
Paulie, you're late.

472
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.836
You call the hospital?

473
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.048
She calls the hospital<br>if I'm ten minutes late.

474
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.675
Yo, how you doing?

475
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.095
I told you, she's very excited.

476
00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:45.017
Why didn't you tell me<br>you were bringing him here?

477
00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.685
I'm not ready for this.

478
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.188
Would it make a difference<br>if you were?

479
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:51.732
- He's taking you out.<br>- No, I can't.

480
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.820
I want you out of the kitchen<br>right now.

481
00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:57.738
I won't.

482
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:05.162
I want you out of here instamatically!

483
00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:07.832
I'm sick of seeing you<br>hanging around like a freaking spider.

484
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:10.084
Go out and live. Enjoy life!

485
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:11.919
I can't go!

486
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.921
Don't get wise with me now.

487
00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.714
I'm tired of you being a loser.

488
00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:18.008
Don't call me that, Paulie!

489
00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:20.970
Apollo Creed says<br>he'll be shopping for another victim

490
00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:24.849
to fill Green's vacancy<br>for the Bicentennial championship fight...

491
00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:26.600
Why didn't you tell me<br>you were bringing him home?

492
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:27.977
How do you know I didn't?

493
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:30.896
I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!

494
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.106
Why?

495
00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:36.569
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br>I got a turkey in the oven.

496
00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:39.280
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

497
00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.788
Turkey in the oven.

498
00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:58.591
You want the bird?<br>Go in the alley and eat the bird!

499
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.634
Aw, Paulie!

500
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.638
I want you out of here!<br>Get out of the house!

501
00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.433
Go out and enjoy your freaking life!

502
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:13.314
You hungry, Rock?

503
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:23.657
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better<br>forget all this, you know?

504
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:27.286
Forget nothing. Go ahead.<br>Tell her something funny.

505
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.539
Ain't nothing to talk about.<br>She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

506
00:37:30.624 --> 00:37:33.417
You can do funny things.<br>You wanna go out with my sister?

507
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.002
- Yeah.<br>- Well...

508
00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.841
I don't know what to say.

509
00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.134
Funny.

510
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.856
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

511
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:57.900
Rocky, you know?

512
00:37:58.568 --> 00:37:59.818
Listen,

513
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.533
I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br>never talked to no door before.

514
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:10.955
What do I say to a door?<br>We better forget this.

515
00:38:11.373 --> 00:38:12.456
You're doing fine.

516
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.833
I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.

517
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.961
Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.

518
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.213
I know all about these things.

519
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.048
I feel like a jerk.

520
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:29.473
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

521
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:34.186
Listen, I know you ain't too happy<br>at this moment.

522
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.355
But could you do me a favor?

523
00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:39.400
I ain't got nobody<br>to spend Thanksgiving with.

524
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.903
So, how about maybe you and I

525
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:44.822
go out together, get something to eat.

526
00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:47.449
Maybe laugh a little bit.<br>Who knows, you know?

527
00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:49.284
Would you like to...

528
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:53.914
Would you like to, maybe,<br>you and me go out together?

529
00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.625
What do you think? Would you like to?

530
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.841
We're gonna have a good time.

531
00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:06.385
We'll have a real good time.

532
00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:12.725
Thanks for the bird.

533
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:19.273
I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br>I got a headache.

534
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:34.038
- What's your sister like to do?<br>- Ice-skate.

535
00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:36.081
Adrian, come on.<br>You're letting the heat out.

536
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.500
Who pays the bills around here?

537
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.217
Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,<br>you know?

538
00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:50.804
But it was Thanksgiving.

539
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.723
What?

540
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:54.767
- It was Thanksgiving.<br>- Yeah, to you.

541
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.186
But to me it's Thursday, right?

542
00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:24.213
- It looks kind of quiet.<br>- I think it's closed.

543
00:40:24.297 --> 00:40:27.424
No, I think we're just early<br>or something like that.

544
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.677
- We're closed.<br>- What?

545
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.931
- I said we're closed.<br>- Yeah. Hey, listen.

546
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:37.392
I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.<br>I'll be right back.

547
00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:39.394
- We could go someplace else.<br>- No, it's okay.

548
00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:43.440
Are you closed to the general public,<br>or are you just closed to everybody?

549
00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:47.694
It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.<br>That's why there's nobody here.

550
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:50.072
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.

551
00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:52.616
So do me a favor and not stay here.

552
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.286
- Could you do me a favor?<br>- Come on. We're not operating.

553
00:40:56.538 --> 00:40:59.373
Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.

554
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.959
Doctors say she should go out<br>and exercise.

555
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:04.211
Ice-skating's probably the best thing.

556
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.546
So what do you want from me?

557
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.464
Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.

558
00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:09.133
You can see she ain't feeling too good.

559
00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:12.261
If you can let her on the ice<br>for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.

560
00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:14.138
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

561
00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:16.390
Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

562
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:18.600
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

563
00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:20.727
All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.

564
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.564
You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

565
00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:27.442
Give her the blades.

566
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:29.486
Aren't you skating?

567
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.572
No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

568
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.949
That's when I started fighting.

569
00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:36.910
Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,<br>you know?

570
00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:40.622
You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?

571
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:43.917
Like I was saying<br>before on the way over here,

572
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:47.171
fighting used to be tops with me,<br>but no more.

573
00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:49.756
All I wanted to do out of fighting<br>was prove I was no bum,

574
00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.217
that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

575
00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:55.345
- You never got the chance?<br>- I ain't crying about it.

576
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.681
I still fight. I do it like a hobby.

577
00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.892
The trouble is I'm a southpaw.

578
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:02.936
- What's a southpaw?<br>- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

579
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.355
A southpaw throws your timing off.

580
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.774
It throws other guys' timing off,<br>makes them look awkward.

581
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.401
Nobody wants to look awkward.

582
00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:12.696
- You know where "southpaw" came from?<br>- Nine minutes!

583
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.824
A long time ago, there was this guy,<br>maybe a couple hundred years ago,

584
00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:19.369
he was fighting in the...<br>I think it was around Philadelphia.

585
00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:23.373
His arm... He was left-handed.<br>His arm was facing towards New Jersey.

586
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:27.336
And that's south. So naturally<br>they called him "south paw." You see?

587
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.714
Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.

588
00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:33.008
Southpaw. You know what I mean?

589
00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:36.637
Things probably worked out for the best,<br>don't you think?

590
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.389
Never got a chance<br>because you're left-handed, huh?

591
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:41.558
That's absolutely true, you know?

592
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:42.893
Watch out.

593
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:47.940
Ah! Ah! I just dislocated my finger.

594
00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:49.816
Ah! Look at that.

595
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:52.361
Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.

596
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:54.821
See? I had it... It's an old wound.

597
00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:57.115
You see that? Look. See?

598
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.659
Nothing. It bends like that.

599
00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:01.703
I originally done it... Push the button.<br>Bong. It works.

600
00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:04.665
- It ain't your fault. Look.<br>- Seven minutes!

601
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:08.418
I originally done it...<br>I carry pictures of all my fights.

602
00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:11.255
I originally done it<br>in the Baby Crenshaw fight.

603
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.383
Baby's about the size of an<br>airplane. I broke both hands on his face.

604
00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:17.803
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br>don't you think?

605
00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:19.263
Real nice.

606
00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:23.100
Come on. You having a good time?

607
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.727
You can see I ain't too graceful.

608
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:30.190
I don't move well, but I can really swat.<br>I can really hit hard.

609
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:33.944
But I'm a southpaw,<br>and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.

610
00:43:39.158 --> 00:43:41.910
You know how I got started in fighting?

611
00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:42.995
No.

612
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.789
Am I talking too loud?

613
00:43:46.082 --> 00:43:47.624
Three minutes!

614
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:52.296
My father, he's a...<br>My old man, he was never too smart.

615
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.464
He says to me,<br>"You weren't born with much of a brain,

616
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:57.050
"so you better start using your body."

617
00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:59.052
So I become a fighter.

618
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.471
You know what I mean?

619
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:03.390
Why you laughing?

620
00:44:04.726 --> 00:44:07.644
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

621
00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:09.980
What did she say the opposite?

622
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.899
She said,<br>"You weren't born with much of a body,

623
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:14.693
"so you better develop your brain."

624
00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:17.571
- Did she say that?<br>- Yo, time!

625
00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:21.742
- Can I ask you a question?<br>- Absolutely.

626
00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:26.371
- Why do you wanna fight?<br>- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

627
00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:27.456
Hey, yo.

628
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.791
Don't fall!

629
00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:33.462
That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.

630
00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:34.796
You like the way I skate?

631
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:37.924
Last fight I had,<br>I had with this guy named Spider Rico.

632
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.719
He busted my head up there.<br>You see that scar?

633
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:43.805
I'll tell you,<br>things get pretty rough in the ring.

634
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:56.234
You know,<br>some people are very shy by nature.

635
00:44:57.153 --> 00:44:58.528
I suppose.

636
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:04.326
I say you're very shy by nature, you know?

637
00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:06.953
I suppose.

638
00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:11.375
The bum from the dark.

639
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:13.126
Get a job, you bum!

640
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:16.838
Some people think<br>that being shy is a disease,

641
00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.882
but it don't bother me none.

642
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:20.884
Don't bother me either.

643
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.346
So why'd I bother bringing it up?

644
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.598
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

645
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.893
I think we make<br>a sharp couple of coconuts.

646
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.813
I'm dumb and you're shy.<br>What do you think?

647
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.652
I don't understand<br>why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

648
00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:44.282
You gotta be a moron to wanna<br>be a fighter, you know what I mean?

649
00:45:44.826 --> 00:45:48.286
It's a racket where you're<br>almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

650
00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:51.832
- I don't think you're a bum.<br>- I'm at least half a bum.

651
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:54.209
But I'll tell you something.

652
00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:57.629
Worst thing about fighting<br>is the morning after.

653
00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:59.089
- You know?<br>- Morning after.

654
00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:01.091
Yeah, the morning after a fight,

655
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.718
you're like a large wound,<br>you know what I mean?

656
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:05.846
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

657
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.599
I feel like calling a taxi to take me<br>from the bed into the bathroom.

658
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:11.601
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.

659
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:14.563
Your face is busted up.<br>Your hands are swollen.

660
00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.732
Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br>Look at that nose.

661
00:46:17.817 --> 00:46:20.569
You see that nose?<br>That nose ain't never been broken.

662
00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:22.946
I had guys busting on it.

663
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.116
I had guys chewing on it,<br>twisting and punching it.

664
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.784
I mean, whack, boom.

665
00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:30.370
These guys are hitting my nose<br>all the time.

666
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.414
Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.

667
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.082
That's rare.

668
00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:37.210
- Why do you do it if it hurts?<br>- Why you think?

669
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.256
'Cause you can't sing and dance?

670
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:44.050
Yeah, something like that.

671
00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:46.261
Hey, you wanna come inside?

672
00:46:48.598 --> 00:46:49.806
No, I gotta go.

673
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.892
Hey, come on. I got some animals.

674
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.352
I got these very rare animals inside.

675
00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:56.021
Come on in.

676
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.564
No, I gotta go.

677
00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:00.484
I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.

678
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:02.194
Come on.

679
00:47:02.278 --> 00:47:04.029
No, I gotta go.

680
00:47:04.113 --> 00:47:07.782
Look at this face.<br>Is that a face you could trust or what?

681
00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:12.245
Is it? They ought to stick this face<br>on a stamp. What do you think?

682
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.414
Come on in.

683
00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:21.421
Yo, come on.

684
00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:43.360
Click.

685
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:50.784
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?

686
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.202
No.

687
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.995
I got some things in there.

688
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.957
If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.

689
00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.292
Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?

690
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:00.585
No?

691
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.463
I got some chocolate in there. No?

692
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.057
Hot in here, you know?

693
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.270
I could go for some music.

694
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.318
Yo, Adrian.

695
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.572
These are the exotic animals<br>I was telling you about.

696
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.740
These are my friends, Cuff and Link.

697
00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:33.618
- I sold them to you.<br>- I know you sold them to me.

698
00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:36.204
Remember you were working<br>at that pet shop?

699
00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:39.749
First day you was there, and I came in<br>and bought both these animals?

700
00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:40.917
I remember that.

701
00:48:41.002 --> 00:48:44.754
I bought this bowl<br>and the animals themselves.

702
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:47.424
Some food,<br>the marbles that go on the bottom there.

703
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:49.426
Remember that mountain?

704
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.722
I had to get rid of that mountain.<br>They kept fall over and flipping.

705
00:48:57.184 --> 00:49:00.020
Why don't you come over here<br>and sit down?

706
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:04.566
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

707
00:49:06.736 --> 00:49:09.863
There's big bugs in there.<br>It's safer over here.

708
00:49:12.408 --> 00:49:14.200
You wanna sit down?

709
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:22.417
These your parents?

710
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.753
Yeah, that's both of them there.

711
00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:27.464
- Is this you?<br>- Yeah. I was eight years old.

712
00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:30.717
That's the Italian Stallion<br>when he was a baby.

713
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:36.056
Come on over.<br>Make yourself comfortable. Relax.

714
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.812
Do you have a phone?

715
00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:44.773
No, I had it pulled.

716
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:46.650
'Cause people calling all the time,

717
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:49.486
and who needs the aggravation, right?

718
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.071
Interruptions.

719
00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:53.156
Who'd you wanna call?

720
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.992
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

721
00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:57.911
Why?

722
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.164
I think he might be worried.

723
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:04.376
I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.

724
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.089
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!

725
00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:11.800
I'll call you back later! See you!

726
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.684
You don't like the room, do you?

727
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.770
- It's fine.<br>- It's only temporary.

728
00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.939
It's not that.

729
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.905
What's the problem? You don't like me?

730
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.199
You don't like the turtles?<br>What's the problem?

731
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:39.035
- I don't think I belong here.<br>- It's okay.

732
00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:43.623
I don't belong here.

733
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.585
Well, you know, it's okay,<br>'cause you're my guest.

734
00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:51.715
I don't know you well enough.

735
00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:55.135
I've never been<br>in a man's apartment alone.

736
00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.806
Well, they're all the same, you know?

737
00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:07.522
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

738
00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.942
I don't feel comfortable.

739
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:13.987
Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.

740
00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:17.907
I should go.

741
00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:20.326
Don't go, please. Don't go.

742
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.663
Don't go.

743
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:28.877
Do me a favor.

744
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.170
What?

745
00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:32.172
Take off these glasses.

746
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:38.136
You have nice eyes, you know?

747
00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:41.765
Do me another favor?

748
00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:45.143
Why don't you take off that hat?

749
00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:53.693
I always knew you was pretty.

750
00:51:55.196 --> 00:51:57.864
- Don't tease me.<br>- I'm not teasing you.

751
00:52:01.202 --> 00:52:03.036
I ain't teasing you.

752
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:06.706
I just wanna... I wanna kiss you.

753
00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:12.378
You don't have to kiss me back<br>if you don't wanna,

754
00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:14.297
but I wanna kiss you.

755
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.706
- Heard you had a fight coming up.<br>- Next month.

756
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.541
January 27, right?

757
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.585
That's good. Come down to the gym.

758
00:53:33.669 --> 00:53:35.962
We'll get you in shape.<br>How's your weight?

759
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.882
- 175.<br>- Hey, Rock. How you doing?

760
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:41.175
Mick was looking for you up there, man.

761
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.469
- For me? You're sure?<br>- Yeah, yeah.

762
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.680
He's looking for you.<br>Get up there and see him.

763
00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:48.182
- He wanted me?<br>- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?

764
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:50.184
- Yeah.<br>- All right. Go on, babe.

765
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.326
You got something for me?

766
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.245
Yeah, there was some guy<br>from Miles Jergens looking for you.

767
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.790
They need sparring partners<br>for Apollo Creed. There's the card.

768
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:14.584
- When was he here?<br>- About an hour ago.

769
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:17.921
They're probably looking<br>for sparring partners for Creed.

770
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.506
I said that before, you dumb Dago!

771
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:25.219
I been coming here for six years,<br>and six years you been sticking it to me.

772
00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:27.805
- How come?<br>- You don't wanna know!

773
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.641
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

774
00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:31.768
- You wanna know?<br>- I wanna know now!

775
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.895
Okay, I'm gonna tell you!

776
00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:38.024
You had the talent to become<br>a good fighter, and instead of that,

777
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:42.236
you became a leg breaker<br>for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

778
00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:44.322
It's a living.

779
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.240
It's a waste of life!

780
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:06.636
Yes. May I help you?

781
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:14.435
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.

782
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.397
Mr. Jergens's expecting you.<br>Just a moment.

783
00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:24.946
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

784
00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:26.614
Fine.

785
00:55:27.408 --> 00:55:29.867
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br>- Can I have that?

786
00:55:29.952 --> 00:55:32.412
- Oh, certainly.<br>- Thanks.

787
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.584
Mr. Balboa.

788
00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:41.087
How are you? George Jergens.

789
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.797
Take a chair, please.

790
00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:44.090
Thanks.

791
00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:47.343
Mr. Balboa.

792
00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:49.762
Call me Rocky.

793
00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:51.889
Rocky, you got any representation?

794
00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:53.474
You have a manager?

795
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:54.976
No, just me.

796
00:55:56.603 --> 00:56:00.440
Rocky, I've got a proposition<br>I'd like to make to you.

797
00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:04.027
- About sparring?<br>- Beg your pardon?

798
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:08.614
I know you're looking for<br>sparring partners, and I'm very available.

799
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.616
- I'm sure you are.<br>- Absolutely.

800
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:12.201
Sparring with the champ<br>would be an honor,

801
00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:13.536
and you know what, Mr. Jergens?

802
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.496
- What?<br>- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

803
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:17.707
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

804
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.126
You don't understand me, Rocky.

805
00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:22.462
My proposition's this.

806
00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:25.673
Would you be interested<br>in fighting Apollo Creed

807
00:56:25.758 --> 00:56:28.468
for the world heavyweight championship?

808
00:56:33.057 --> 00:56:34.140
No.

809
00:56:34.308 --> 00:56:35.850
Listen, Rocky.

810
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.811
Apollo's seen you fight.

811
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.230
He likes you.

812
00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:43.066
He wants to fight you.

813
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.901
Well, it's just that, you see,

814
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:48.154
I fight in clubs, you know,<br>and I'm really a ham-and-egger.

815
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.073
This guy, he's the best, and

816
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.826
it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br>but thank you very much.

817
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:55.745
I appreciate it.

818
00:56:55.829 --> 00:57:00.166
Rocky, do you believe that America<br>is the land of opportunity?

819
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:02.668
Yeah.

820
00:57:03.545 --> 00:57:05.254
Apollo Creed does,

821
00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:07.590
and he's gonna prove it to the whole world

822
00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:10.384
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

823
00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:12.887
And that unknown is you.

824
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.473
He picked you, Rocky.

825
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:18.935
It's the chance of a lifetime.

826
00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:22.021
You can't pass it by.

827
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.190
What do you say?

828
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.864
All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.

829
00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:33.783
We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.

830
00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:36.410
Apollo, how do you like<br>the City of Brotherly Love?

831
00:57:36.495 --> 00:57:39.914
Well, just being in Philadelphia<br>makes me feel patriotic.

832
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:42.708
Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br>coming up to me on the street,

833
00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:43.960
wishing me the best.

834
00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:46.796
I love my Philadelphia brothers,<br>and I'm proud to be an American.

835
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.422
Apollo? Champ?

836
00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:52.343
Why did you agree to fight a man<br>who has virtually no chance of winning?

837
00:57:52.427 --> 00:57:54.720
If history proves one thing,

838
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:58.558
American history proves that<br>everybody's got a chance to win.

839
00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:01.769
Didn't you guys ever hear<br>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?

840
00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:03.354
Apollo?

841
00:58:03.438 --> 00:58:05.982
It is a coincidence<br>that you're fighting a white man

842
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.025
on the most celebrated day<br>in the country's history?

843
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:11.320
I don't know. Is it a coincidence<br>that he's fighting a black man

844
00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:13.739
on the most celebrated day<br>in the country's history?

845
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.825
- Right on, Apollo!<br>- Tell the truth, brother!

846
00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:18.494
Listen, Apollo.<br>How do you feel about your challenger?

847
00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:21.330
How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.

848
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.124
My main man.

849
00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:25.877
- Rocky, ain't you Italian?<br>- Yeah, I'm Italian.

850
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.670
Now what does that mean?

851
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:30.631
That means, if he can't fight,<br>I'll bet he can cook.

852
00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.886
Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.

853
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.387
Paulie.

854
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:39.724
Rocky, how do you expect<br>to fight Apollo Creed?

855
00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:42.476
Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.

856
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.228
I guess I'll have to do the best I can.

857
00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:46.981
Tell me, Rocky, just between us,

858
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:50.109
where did you get<br>the name "Italian Stallion"?

859
00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:54.614
Oh, I invented that about eight years ago<br>when I was eating dinner.

860
00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:59.493
Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.

861
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.037
Any comment?

862
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.167
- You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br>- No.

863
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:07.710
- Thank you, Rocky.<br>- Wait a minute.

864
00:59:07.794 --> 00:59:10.713
I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?

865
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:12.924
Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.

866
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.761
You believe all this?<br>Microphones and all that stuff.

867
00:59:16.845 --> 00:59:17.970
You didn't.

868
00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:20.389
- Thank you, Rocky.<br>- Who you pushing, man?

869
00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:22.808
- Smack you in the mouth!<br>- Thank you, Rocky.

870
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:24.769
Don't it matter he making you out a fool?

871
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:26.479
I'd break his lips.

872
00:59:26.605 --> 00:59:30.191
- He's taking cheap shots.<br>- Don't bother me none.

873
00:59:30.275 --> 00:59:35.071
Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br>for people to help you out.

874
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.447
Help what?

875
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:37.740
You know,

876
00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:39.742
keep you living the clean life.

877
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:42.078
I do okay, you know.

878
00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:44.121
You need someone<br>to help with the exercise

879
00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:48.084
and someone standing by with a towel<br>or running errands?

880
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.920
Hey, yo, Paulie,<br>who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.

881
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:53.589
So I just think I'm gonna train myself,<br>you know?

882
00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:55.800
Without such good people around<br>to help you,

883
00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:58.344
you don't have such a good chance.

884
00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.055
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

885
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.640
That so?

886
01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:06.686
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br>Helen Keller was blind.

887
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.689
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

888
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.446
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

889
01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:21.325
You looking to do a good deed?<br>Keep out of my freaking life!

890
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.078
- What'd I do?<br>- Nothing.

891
01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.746
Did I say something wrong?

892
01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.581
You didn't say nothing. It's all right.

893
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.667
That's right! You didn't say nothing!

894
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.335
Nothing at all!

895
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.714
I gotta go.

896
01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.259
Where are the freaking pretzels?

897
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.264
I'd like to have a pretzel.

898
01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.474
Hey, we ain't got any beer?

899
01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:49.520
I thought you were supposed to<br>pick up some beer!

900
01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.947
How'd you like hearing your name<br>on TV tonight?

901
01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.200
I was shocked.

902
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.702
Why'd you do that?

903
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.537
You're putting me on, right?

904
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.039
Absolutely.

905
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.542
- What time should I expect you?<br>- About 7:00.

906
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.586
- Okay.<br>- Hey.

907
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:34.565
You know how I said<br>that stuff on TV didn't bother me?

908
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:35.941
Yeah.

909
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.820
It did.

910
01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:54.043
Listen, the reason I brought you here<br>is because

911
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.462
I wanna know if you got any money<br>for training expenses.

912
01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.297
I got a few dollars.

913
01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.633
A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.

914
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.803
- What's this?<br>- $500. Don't worry about it.

915
01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.931
You know, you ain't never had any luck,

916
01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:09.517
but I think this time Lady Luck<br>may be in your corner.

917
01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.561
- What do you think?<br>- Maybe.

918
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.563
Thanks for the money, Tony.

919
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.733
It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.

920
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.777
- Wait a minute.<br>- What?

921
01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.987
You're in training. Come on.

922
01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.789
- Yo, Tony.<br>- What?

923
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.917
You gonna show up at the fight?

924
01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.293
Ringside.

925
01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.172
I'll see you.

926
01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.459
Yeah.

927
01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.551
Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?

928
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.928
- Yeah, sure.<br>- Yeah. Good.

929
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:30.139
Hey, it's a nice place here.

930
01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.726
Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,

931
01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.355
that what happened to you is freak luck.

932
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.357
- Yeah, freak luck.<br>- Ain't it true?

933
01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.985
Look at the other guys.<br>They're good fighters, right?

934
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.738
They're colorful. They got good records.

935
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.157
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

936
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.161
But you, you got a shot at the title!

937
01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:54.705
Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?

938
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.333
- Sure is. Can I sit down?<br>- Yeah, sure.

939
01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:02.004
- What the hell are those?<br>- Domestic turtles.

940
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.632
The one on the top is Cuff<br>and the other guy's Link.

941
01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:05.925
The rest are marbles.

942
01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.385
Yeah? They make good soup.

943
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.262
Anyway.

944
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.224
Look, I'm here to warn you.

945
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:17.853
You gotta be very careful<br>about this shot that you got at the title.

946
01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.689
Because, like the Bible says,

947
01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.942
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

948
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.152
Yeah. All right.

949
01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:27.154
You thought of that, huh?

950
01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:30.658
Well, what you need is a manager.

951
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.702
A manager. Listen to me.

952
01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.498
I know, because I been in this racket<br>for 50 years.

953
01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.876
- 50 years, huh?<br>- 50 years. I've seen it all.

954
01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:44.255
- All of it. You know what I done?<br>- What?

955
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.340
I have done it all.

956
01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:50.219
You should've seen me when<br>I knocked Ginny Russell out of the ring.

957
01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.221
Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.

958
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.306
September 14, 1923,

959
01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.727
and it was the same night<br>that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

960
01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:01.230
So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.

961
01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.232
- Dempsey.<br>- That's right. But why?

962
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:07.152
- 'Cause he was champ.<br>- No! Because he had a manager.

963
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.821
I had nothing.

964
01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.575
I wanna show you something.<br>I want you to look at my face.

965
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.995
Look at this.<br>I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

966
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.539
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

967
01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:22.042
You know I had my nose busted 17 times.

968
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:26.714
The last time<br>was in that fight with Sailor Mike.

969
01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.717
I got that clipping here.<br>It was a good fight.

970
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.719
Wanna read that?

971
01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.929
Well, it doesn't matter.

972
01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:37.516
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

973
01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:46.900
You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br>you know that?

974
01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.028
- You really think so?<br>- That's right.

975
01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.489
You move like him,<br>and you got heart like he did.

976
01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:56.201
Yeah, I got heart,<br>but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

977
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.749
Anyway.

978
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.918
You know, when I begun<br>in this business, kid...

979
01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:11.175
I wanna make a suggestion.<br>Don't drink that piss before a fight.

980
01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.385
It's no good for you.

981
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.846
If you don't mind my saying.

982
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.140
Anyway, you know,<br>when I started in this racket,

983
01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.476
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

984
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.978
For $10, you got to<br>tear somebody's throat out.

985
01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:25.314
But I never had no management.

986
01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.652
One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,

987
01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.695
he put a nail right there.

988
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.114
- In his thumb.<br>- In the thumb of the glove.

989
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:39.328
He punched so many holes in my face,<br>I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.

990
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.664
Can you imagine that?

991
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.334
Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like<br>when I was in my prime.

992
01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.169
I want you to look at something.

993
01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.880
Look at that. That's the way I looked

994
01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.925
before these guys got at me.

995
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.762
That's nice. You didn't take very good care<br>of the picture, though.

996
01:06:56.846 --> 01:07:00.057
Well, I never had no management.

997
01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.351
That's the trouble,<br>but now I got all this knowledge.

998
01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.187
I got it up here.<br>Now I wanna give it to you.

999
01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.981
I wanna give you this knowledge.<br>I wanna take care of you.

1000
01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:11.276
I wanna make sure that what happened<br>to me doesn't happen to you.

1001
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.153
You know what I mean?

1002
01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.030
Mick, the fight's set.

1003
01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:17.741
Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

1004
01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.201
You follow that?

1005
01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.537
Fight's set. I don't need no manager.

1006
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.956
But you can't buy<br>what I'm gonna give you.

1007
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.417
I got pain and I got experience.

1008
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.044
I got pain and I got experience too.

1009
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.171
Listen, kid.

1010
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.881
Hey, Mick.

1011
01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:35.592
I needed your help<br>about 10 years ago, right?

1012
01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:38.679
Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br>You didn't care.

1013
01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.597
If you wanted help...

1014
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:45.227
I say, if you wanted help,<br>why didn't you just ask me, kid?

1015
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.938
I asked, but you never heard nothing!

1016
01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.232
Well, I...

1017
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.862
I know I...

1018
01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.613
I'm 76 years old.

1019
01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.536
And...

1020
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.491
Took you long enough to get here.

1021
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.410
Took 10 years to come to my house.

1022
01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:45.496
You don't like my house?

1023
01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.790
My house stink?

1024
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.918
That's right, it stinks!

1025
01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.378
I didn't ask no favors from you!

1026
01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.258
Talk about your prime.

1027
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.677
What about my prime, Mick?

1028
01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:02.888
At least you had a prime!

1029
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.808
I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.

1030
01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.894
Legs are going, everything is going.<br>Nobody's giving me nothing.

1031
01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.146
Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.

1032
01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.732
Wanna fight the fight?<br>Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1033
01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:17.402
I'm gonna go fight that big fight<br>and I'm gonna get that!

1034
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.571
I'm gonna get that!

1035
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.908
And you wanna be ringside and see?

1036
01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.035
Do you? You wanna help me out?

1037
01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:27.871
Do you wanna see me<br>get my face kicked in?

1038
01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.957
Legs ain't working, nothing's working.

1039
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.501
Think I'll go and fight the champ.

1040
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.753
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1041
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.091
Get my face kicked in.

1042
01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.511
And you come around here.<br>You wanna move in with me?

1043
01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.805
Come on in. It's a nice house!

1044
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.141
Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!

1045
01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.436
This whole place stinks.

1046
01:09:51.896 --> 01:09:53.772
You wanna help me out?

1047
01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:57.985
Well, help me out! Come on. Help me out.<br>I'm standing here!

1048
01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.756
It's only about<br>28 degrees. We'll check that forecast.

1049
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.759
I feel very mischievous, very weird, very...

1050
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.346
I got vinyl seats in my car.

1051
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.515
When I hit those seats this morning,<br>I just went, "Whoo!"

1052
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.853
I figure if I'm up, everybody<br>in the Delaware Valley should be up.

1053
01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.271
You agree with me?

1054
01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:20.192
At three minutes past 4:00 in the morning,<br>what else you gonna do?

1055
01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:22.861
Hello?

1056
01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:26.490
Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.<br>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?

1057
01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.784
- How are you this morning?<br>- What?

1058
01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:32.788
You have a lot of nerve<br>calling me at this hour of the morning!

1059
01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.164
Good-bye!

1060
01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.972
Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,<br>and it's a good morning.

1061
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.683
I tell you, I need someone<br>to snuggle with. 28 degrees.

1062
01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.810
It's cold out there. We deserve it.

1063
01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:57.354
We've been getting away with murder<br>the last couple of weeks.

1064
01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.523
Our high today could be...

1065
01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:02.484
Tonight we're back down<br>in the 20-degree range.

1066
01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.069
A little colder in the suburbs.

1067
01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.322
Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,<br>we may hit 40.

1068
01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.366
But it's 28. It's awfully chilly.

1069
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.202
Make sure you have it bundled up<br>before you bring it out.

1070
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.595
Come on.

1071
01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:39.141
It stinks in here, you know?

1072
01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.059
Yeah. I know.

1073
01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.063
Did you kill all these things?

1074
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.607
No, across the street.

1075
01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:52.404
It's like an animal morgue.

1076
01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:54.656
It's a little cold in here, ain't it?

1077
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.907
Yeah.

1078
01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.581
Who killed all these things?

1079
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.666
Are you crazy, Paulie?

1080
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.002
If you don't pay Gazzo,<br>you end up on a hook.

1081
01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:09.296
Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

1082
01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.173
Don't get excited. I know that.

1083
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:15.177
That's why I wanted you to talk to him<br>about me and the collecting job.

1084
01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.762
I can get me out of this stinking freezer.

1085
01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.850
Why don't you do yourself a favor?<br>Keep this job. You eat better.

1086
01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.311
Moo.

1087
01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.022
Does it ever snow in here?

1088
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.985
You and my sister,<br>how you getting along together?

1089
01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:34.571
How do you think?

1090
01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.741
I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

1091
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.118
About what?

1092
01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.037
What's happening?

1093
01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.539
You really like her?

1094
01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.291
Sure, I like her.

1095
01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.046
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

1096
01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.883
I don't know. Fills gaps, I guess.

1097
01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:57.135
What's "gaps"?

1098
01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:01.473
I don't know. She's got gaps.<br>I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

1099
01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:05.560
You balling her?

1100
01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:06.978
Hey.

1101
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.482
You don't talk dirty about your sister.

1102
01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.444
Are you screwing my sister?

1103
01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:20.367
You see?<br>That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo.

1104
01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.787
Because you got a big mouth.<br>You just talk too much.

1105
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.707
- It's cold in here. I'm going home.<br>- Cold in here?

1106
01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.376
It is cold in here!

1107
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.878
It stinks in here, and you stink!

1108
01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.492
You're breaking the ribs.

1109
01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:25.890
If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br>they'll put us in jail for murder.

1110
01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:30.270
I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?

1111
01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.243
- I turned the heat up.<br>- Thanks.

1112
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.581
Your brother's a good man,<br>but he's awful pushy, you know?

1113
01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.927
- You want me to rub you down?<br>- No, I'm just sore, okay?

1114
01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:05.263
- I'm gonna just sit here.<br>- You sure?

1115
01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:06.765
Yeah, I'm sure.

1116
01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.313
Hey, come on. No fooling around, all right?

1117
01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:14.981
I'm tired.

1118
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.817
Adrian, I'm serious now.

1119
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.778
There's no fooling around during training.

1120
01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.613
I wanna stay strong.

1121
01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.783
- You're not kidding.<br>- No, I ain't kidding.

1122
01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:29.746
- You sure?<br>- Yeah, I'm sure.

1123
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.540
Why don't you just make the meat, okay?

1124
01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:36.461
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1125
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.948
- It's okay.<br>- I'm sorry.

1126
01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:06.991
Hey.

1127
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.608
Underneath! Underneath!<br>Knock him out! Come on!

1128
01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.777
Hold it. Hold it, Rock!

1129
01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:46.865
You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy<br>because you're off balance.

1130
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.867
Let's try this. Take this string.

1131
01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.535
Tie it to both ankles.

1132
01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.705
- Leave about two feet of slack.<br>- I never had good footwork.

1133
01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.374
Never mind footwork.<br>Now you're all balanced.

1134
01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.960
Marciano had the same problem

1135
01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.212
and this string cured it.

1136
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:06.634
If you can move and hit without<br>breaking the string, you got balance!

1137
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.970
You become a dangerous person.

1138
01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.055
- You follow me?<br>- Looking good, Rock.

1139
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.183
- Thanks.<br>- Let's go. That's it.

1140
01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:15.185
- Underneath it.<br>- Hey, Rock.

1141
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.353
- What?<br>- How about an autograph?

1142
01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:18.855
Get out of here!

1143
01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.733
Don't interrupt me<br>while I'm conducting business.

1144
01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.068
Move your little chicken asses out.

1145
01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:28.406
Hey, listen, kid.<br>You lay off that pet shop dame.

1146
01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.159
Women weaken legs.

1147
01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.704
Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?

1148
01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.706
Then let her train you!

1149
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.294
Okay, no more fooling around.

1150
01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.046
Okay. Now hit it.

1151
01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.966
Women weaken legs, huh?

1152
01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.264
- Yo, Rock.<br>- Yo, Rocky.

1153
01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.276
You look great.

1154
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.279
- Really?<br>- Oh, yeah.

1155
01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.949
Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreak.

1156
01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.826
You'll walk down the street<br>breaking hearts the way you're looking.

1157
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:14.953
Very sharp.

1158
01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.664
I got another surprise for you.

1159
01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:18.790
What?

1160
01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:22.085
Butkus! Hey, Butkus.

1161
01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.087
Come here, kid.

1162
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.548
To keep you company when you run.

1163
01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.556
Come in and meet the family.<br>The owner never come back?

1164
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.558
Gloria says he's yours if you want him.

1165
01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:39.394
Do I want him? What's he eat?

1166
01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.354
He eats little turtles.

1167
01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:07.755
What's that, Butkus?

1168
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.882
Whose truck is this? Come on.

1169
01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.846
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

1170
01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:18.433
You got... Need exposure.

1171
01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:20.768
- Don't breathe on me.<br>- That's the big time.

1172
01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.437
Don't I know about these things?

1173
01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.731
You don't know nothing.<br>What do they want from me?

1174
01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.441
To watch you train.

1175
01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:29.277
What is the matter with you?<br>This is supposed to be private.

1176
01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:31.779
- I'm doing you a favor.<br>- You ain't doing me no favors!

1177
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.781
You're embarrassing me<br>in front of everybody.

1178
01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.825
You'll make me look bad<br>in front of your sis...

1179
01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:38.202
See this cigar?<br>I'm gonna stick it in your ear.

1180
01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.414
Don't do these things to me.<br>You should've called me.

1181
01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.833
Leave a message. Don't do that.

1182
01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.628
My sister really likes you.

1183
01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:50.131
I'm gonna kill you one of these days!

1184
01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.466
Come on.

1185
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.301
- Baby!<br>- Baby.

1186
01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:57.639
Here he is, the next heavyweight<br>champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

1187
01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.641
Hello there. Rocky Balboa.

1188
01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.643
We wanna get a brief interview with you.

1189
01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.561
- What about me?<br>- What about you?

1190
01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:05.980
- I'm in charge of the meat.<br>- Fine. Stand behind it.

1191
01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:08.066
Settle yourself down. Relax.

1192
01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.985
What we're going to do<br>is ask you a few questions.

1193
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.655
Just a few questions<br>about your unique training method.

1194
01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.531
Talk to the folks at home.

1195
01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:17.659
They really wanna know<br>how you got into this.

1196
01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.370
This isn't an everyday thing.<br>Jimmy, you guys ready?

1197
01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.580
Let's roll it. Rocky, turn around here.

1198
01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.499
Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?

1199
01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.542
No, I won't do that. Just relax.

1200
01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:30.088
Today we're here with<br>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1201
01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.839
The reason we're standing in this...

1202
01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.425
The meat guy's sticking<br>his face in.

1203
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.594
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1204
01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.473
Today we're here with<br>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1205
01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.101
The reason we're standing<br>in this refrigerated box

1206
01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:46.354
is that Mr. Balboa<br>has an unusual method of training.

1207
01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.941
In a moment, he'll demonstrate that<br>for the viewing audience at home.

1208
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.611
But first, Rocky,<br>how did you come to train in an icebox?

1209
01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:57.031
Well, my friend, the guy over there,

1210
01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:59.992
he let me in one day,<br>and I hit the beef here and liked it,

1211
01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:03.454
and since I've become a challenger,<br>the owner don't mind that I come in.

1212
01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:07.417
Is this a common training method?<br>Do other fighters pound raw meat?

1213
01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.460
No, I think I invented it.

1214
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.255
- Would you give us a demonstration?<br>- Confirm the reservation

1215
01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:15.800
for my people at ringside,<br>and fly my barber to Philly.

1216
01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:22.265
How much is being channeled<br>into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?

1217
01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.642
- 300,000.<br>- Make it 450.

1218
01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.145
And send the mayor's wife<br>200 roses from me,

1219
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.981
and make sure we get a picture of it<br>for all the newspapers.

1220
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:33.109
Do you want to run the 15 radio spots<br>in the Midwest?

1221
01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.778
You can spend your money better<br>in Canadian publicity.

1222
01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:38.573
By the way, Apollo,<br>I've got friends in Toronto

1223
01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.616
who can get you a good tax break.

1224
01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.869
George, I like your friends.

1225
01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:55.256
Hey, Champ. You ought to come<br>look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

1226
01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:59.093
- Looks like he means business.<br>- Yeah, I mean business too.

1227
01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.345
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?

1228
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:04.056
Certainly, Mr. Creed.<br>I'll get you some right away.

1229
01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:07.351
After the fight,<br>I may retire and run for emperor.

1230
01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:24.202
Diana Lewis in the meat house

1231
01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.746
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

1232
01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:15.169
And he called the reporters?

1233
01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:17.839
Yeah.<br>Threw my training schedule off.

1234
01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:20.049
Don't be mad at him. He's trying to help.

1235
01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:21.968
Adrian, I ain't mad,

1236
01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:25.263
it's just that when reporters are<br>around, I get out of joint

1237
01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:28.641
'cause they take cheap shots,<br>and Paulie knows that.

1238
01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:32.019
And Paulie keeps asking me<br>for a job all the time

1239
01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:34.856
but he don't know nothing about fighting.

1240
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.441
Are you gonna say anything to him?

1241
01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:41.696
What's to say?<br>I just don't know what he wants from me.

1242
01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:49.245
I don't want nothing from you.

1243
01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:53.958
This ain't no charity case.<br>Get out of my house.

1244
01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.043
It's not just your house.

1245
01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:59.005
You're no friend no more.

1246
01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.466
- Get out of my house, I just says.<br>- Don't talk to him like that.

1247
01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.844
Both of you get out of my house!

1248
01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.890
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1249
01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:20.985
I don't want you messing her

1250
01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.613
and I don't raise you<br>to go with this scum bum!

1251
01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:25.489
Yeah? Come on! You wanna hit on me?

1252
01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.410
Come on! I'll break both your arms<br>so they don't work for you.

1253
01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:32.830
Stop it!

1254
01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:36.208
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?<br>That's what I think of Gazzo!

1255
01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:40.838
Now you're a big shot fighter, you<br>don't even throw a crumb to your friend.

1256
01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:43.132
When I go and get your meat<br>every morning!

1257
01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.760
You forgot that?<br>And then I even give you my sister too!

1258
01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:48.471
- Only a pig would say that!<br>- I'm a pig?

1259
01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:51.223
A pig gets you the best?

1260
01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:55.227
You're such a loser!<br>I don't get married because of you!

1261
01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:57.730
You can't live by yourself!

1262
01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:01.776
I put you two together,<br>and don't you forget it!

1263
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.277
You owe me!

1264
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:07.907
- You owe me!<br>- What do I owe you?

1265
01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.409
You're supposed to be good to me!

1266
01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:13.996
What do I owe you, Paulie?

1267
01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:15.706
I treat you good!

1268
01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:19.168
I cook for you, I clean for you,<br>I pick up your dirty clothes!

1269
01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:22.546
I take care of you, Paulie!<br>I don't owe you nothing!

1270
01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:25.758
And you made me feel like a loser!

1271
01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.594
I'm not a loser!

1272
01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:30.471
- You're busted!<br>- What?

1273
01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.390
You're not a virgin!

1274
01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.101
You let a man take down your pants!

1275
01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:36.644
She's busted!

1276
01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.816
I can't haul meat no more!

1277
01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.056
You want a roommate?

1278
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.354
Absolutely.

1279
01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:24.525
Okay, now<br>when you walk into the ring

1280
01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:27.361
with the number one<br>heavyweight of the world

1281
01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.071
you'll be ready, won't you?

1282
01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:32.575
Why? Because I waited for 50 years

1283
01:29:32.659 --> 01:29:34.326
to make you ready.

1284
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:36.829
You'll be able to spit nails, kid!

1285
01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:39.540
Like the guy says,<br>you're gonna eat lightning

1286
01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.500
and you're gonna crap thunder!

1287
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:44.336
You're gonna become<br>a very dangerous person.

1288
01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:45.713
Yo, Mickey.

1289
01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:47.882
Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.

1290
01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:51.052
I want you to meet our cut man here.<br>Al Salvani.

1291
01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:53.095
- Take a look at his eye.<br>- How you doing, Al?

1292
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.598
- That's right.<br>- It ain't bad. Seen worse.

1293
01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:58.517
- You ain't so bad yourself.<br>- Cover up. Things will be okay.

1294
01:29:58.602 --> 01:29:59.769
You cover up.

1295
01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:01.604
Go and take a shower.

1296
01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.148
Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.

1297
01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.235
You covered that Whitmore fight?

1298
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.072
- That's why he won.<br>- Listen. We got a winner here.

1299
01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:15.242
We got a chance. He goes to the body<br>like nobody you've ever seen.

1300
01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:18.162
You just stand by. We're gonna win.

1301
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:27.671
Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?

1302
01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.008
Okay you talk to me? Sure.

1303
01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:34.637
I figured some angle<br>to make some money off your name.

1304
01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:37.389
My name? How's that?

1305
01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:40.184
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

1306
01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.522
What do you know about advertising?

1307
01:30:47.818 --> 01:30:50.736
Hey, you can make money off my name,<br>make it, okay?

1308
01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:52.822
I'm gonna take a shower.

1309
01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.325
- Wanna help me off with these?<br>- Sure.

1310
01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:33.505
You're gonna kill him!

1311
01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:27.888
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

1312
01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:31.433
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

1313
01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.644
What do you mean?

1314
01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:36.647
I'm wearing white pants with a red stripe.

1315
01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:42.903
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1316
01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:45.823
I'm sure you're gonna give us<br>a great show.

1317
01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:48.909
Try to get some rest, kid.

1318
01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.120
Good night.

1319
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:24.004
I can't do it.

1320
01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:28.175
What?

1321
01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.928
I can't beat him.

1322
01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:33.764
Apollo?

1323
01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:35.641
Yeah.

1324
01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.978
I been out there, walking around, thinking.

1325
01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:45.150
Who am I kidding?<br>I ain't even in the guy's league.

1326
01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:52.366
What are we gonna do?

1327
01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:05.379
I don't know.

1328
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.470
You worked so hard.

1329
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.600
Yeah, it don't matter,<br>'cause I was nobody before.

1330
01:38:20.937 --> 01:38:22.479
Don't say that.

1331
01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:25.524
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

1332
01:38:25.608 --> 01:38:27.109
I was nobody.

1333
01:38:28.987 --> 01:38:31.697
But that don't matter either, you know?

1334
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.658
'Cause I was thinking,

1335
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.829
it really don't matter if I lose this fight.

1336
01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:44.501
It really don't matter<br>if this guy opens my head either.

1337
01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.589
'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.

1338
01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:56.346
Nobody's ever gone the distance<br>with Creed,

1339
01:38:57.223 --> 01:38:59.474
and if I can go that distance,

1340
01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.854
and that bell rings, and I'm still standing,

1341
01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:12.529
I'm gonna know<br>for the first time in my life, see,

1342
01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:17.868
that I weren't just another bum<br>from the neighborhood.

1343
01:40:25.395 --> 01:40:27.187
Time, kid. Let's go.

1344
01:40:30.233 --> 01:40:32.150
I'll wait for you here.

1345
01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:37.280
How about I wait here and you fight, huh?

1346
01:40:38.116 --> 01:40:41.243
You're looking very great today,<br>you know that?

1347
01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:46.289
I gotta go now,<br>but don't you leave town, huh?

1348
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.127
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1349
01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.212
Good luck.

1350
01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:56.299
Adrian, you don't think<br>this robe is too baggy, huh?

1351
01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:57.801
Good luck.

1352
01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.553
Don't leave town.

1353
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:05.559
I'd like you to meet<br>my colleague, Stu Nahan.

1354
01:41:05.643 --> 01:41:07.018
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.

1355
01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:09.813
The electricity is all over the place tonight,<br>as Rocky Balboa...

1356
01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.567
What is that?

1357
01:41:13.651 --> 01:41:15.986
I trained you to be a fighter,<br>not a billboard.

1358
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.697
- I'm doing it for a friend.<br>- What do you get out of it?

1359
01:41:18.781 --> 01:41:20.657
Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.

1360
01:41:20.742 --> 01:41:21.992
Shrewd.

1361
01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:25.245
The story about tonight's fight,<br>their difference in style,

1362
01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:27.581
you can quote<br>a recent sports magazine which said,

1363
01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:29.708
it could be<br>"the caveman against the cavalier."

1364
01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.668
I notice a buzzing in the background.

1365
01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:34.337
Could be the challenger<br>is getting ready to get into the ring.

1366
01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.590
Rocky, look at my date.

1367
01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.717
- Cost me $200.<br>- $250.

1368
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.427
I gotta go. I gotta work.

1369
01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:42.846
- How's the robe?<br>- A little baggy.

1370
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.849
A 50-to-1 underdog<br>living a Cinderella story,

1371
01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:49.686
and he's captured people's imaginations<br>all over the world.

1372
01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:55.984
We love you, Rocky!

1373
01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:59.154
- Good luck, champ.<br>- Thanks for showing up.

1374
01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:01.573
And his record, 44 victories.

1375
01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:04.201
He's had 38 by knockout,<br>and he's lost 20 fights.

1376
01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.661
Which makes me wonder,<br>can he stand it?

1377
01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:09.414
You know, the stamina and the skill<br>to last three rounds.

1378
01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:11.458
Because Las Vegas odds say no.

1379
01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:14.377
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.

1380
01:42:15.087 --> 01:42:16.588
"The Italian Stallion."

1381
01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:20.550
Some meat sign on the back of his robe.<br>You seen what that was?

1382
01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:22.636
Shamrock Meat...

1383
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.931
There's a lot of noise<br>coming from the background.

1384
01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:29.059
- They have spotlights.<br>- I see right back there.

1385
01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:32.646
Is that the world heavyweight champion,<br>Apollo Creed?

1386
01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:36.733
He's riding in a boat.<br>Is he supposed to be George Washington?

1387
01:42:36.818 --> 01:42:40.111
Obviously so.<br>He's got the hat on, the whole thing.

1388
01:42:41.614 --> 01:42:44.157
The world champion, Apollo Creed

1389
01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:47.077
is doing an imitation<br>of George Washington.

1390
01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:49.746
He's throwing money.

1391
01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:53.250
Remember when we were growing up,<br>we were taught about George Washington

1392
01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:54.793
throwing a dollar.

1393
01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:57.587
If you threw a dollar in those days,<br>it went a lot farther.

1394
01:42:57.672 --> 01:43:00.382
Now he's taking his...<br>Blonde wig came off.

1395
01:43:00.466 --> 01:43:02.133
The hat came off.

1396
01:43:03.469 --> 01:43:04.886
I want you!

1397
01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:08.598
The crowd is loving every minute of it.

1398
01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:11.726
- Here is the world heavyweight champion.<br>- Apollo Creed.

1399
01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:13.228
For you around the world

1400
01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:16.231
he was dressed as George Washington,<br>the father of our country.

1401
01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:17.732
I want you!

1402
01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:23.989
I don't believe what I'm seeing.<br>Uncle Sam himself!

1403
01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.574
I want you!

1404
01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:28.535
I want all of you!

1405
01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.954
He looks like a big flag.

1406
01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:33.123
I want you!

1407
01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:36.543
- Is he talking to me?<br>- He's talking to you.

1408
01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.837
- Is he talking to me?<br>- Let him talk.

1409
01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:40.714
I want the Stallion!

1410
01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:43.633
He says, "I want the Stallion."

1411
01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:48.179
For you in foreign countries,<br>during World War I,

1412
01:43:48.264 --> 01:43:51.141
the picture of Uncle Sam<br>with his finger pointed like that

1413
01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:53.643
was a recruiting poster<br>for our fellows in the service,

1414
01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.937
the army and the navy. "I want you."

1415
01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:58.106
That's what<br>he's doing a take on.

1416
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.443
He's yelling, "Creed in three."

1417
01:44:01.527 --> 01:44:03.695
What do you think that outfit cost?

1418
01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:16.249
Ladies and gentlemen.

1419
01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:20.795
Good evening. A very Happy New Year.

1420
01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.923
Welcome to Philadelphia.

1421
01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:25.759
Everybody who's anybody<br>is here tonight.

1422
01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:31.389
Time does not permit me<br>to introduce

1423
01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:34.851
the many luminaries of politics,

1424
01:44:34.936 --> 01:44:39.397
show business and the sporting world<br>who are with us tonight

1425
01:44:39.732 --> 01:44:41.858
but I would like to present

1426
01:44:41.943 --> 01:44:44.986
one of the immortals of pugilism,

1427
01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:48.740
a champion in and out of the ring,

1428
01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:51.576
Philadelphia's own "Smoking Joe,"

1429
01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:54.496
the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!

1430
01:45:05.257 --> 01:45:06.508
How you doing?

1431
01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:08.009
Don't hurt him, okay?

1432
01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:09.719
I'll try not to.

1433
01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:12.180
What a credit he's been<br>in his career as a fighter.

1434
01:45:12.264 --> 01:45:14.391
Now he's coming over<br>to talk to the champ.

1435
01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:16.935
- Hey, Joe.<br>- You been ducking me a long time.

1436
01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.645
No, Joe. You're next.

1437
01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:20.981
- You're next.<br>- You understand?

1438
01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:23.108
They must be friends.

1439
01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:33.326
Joe Frazier!

1440
01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:35.578
- Fight fans, get settled down.<br>- Go home!

1441
01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:38.832
- Don't stay in the arena!<br>- It won't be long now.

1442
01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:43.753
Now for the main event.

1443
01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:49.050
On my left

1444
01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:52.262
the challenger, in white trunks,

1445
01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:55.515
weighing 190 pounds.

1446
01:45:55.599 --> 01:45:58.059
Philadelphia's favorite son,

1447
01:45:58.144 --> 01:46:01.021
The Italian Stallion,

1448
01:46:01.105 --> 01:46:03.189
Rocky Balboa.

1449
01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:12.449
And on my right

1450
01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:14.993
wearing red, white and blue,

1451
01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:18.204
weighing 210 pounds,

1452
01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:21.708
undefeated in 46 fights,

1453
01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:24.502
The Master of Disaster,

1454
01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:28.715
the undisputed heavyweight champion<br>of the world,

1455
01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:30.592
Apollo Creed!

1456
01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:34.929
I want you! You!

1457
01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.435
You, chump. I want you!

1458
01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:43.521
You've both fought in<br>Philadelphia before. You know the rules.

1459
01:46:43.606 --> 01:46:46.733
No low blows,<br>watch your heads, no butting.

1460
01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:48.568
Shake hands and come out fighting.

1461
01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:50.320
Put your hands up there, chump.

1462
01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:52.530
- Come out fighting.<br>- Come on!

1463
01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:59.454
Rocky's just going over<br>and being calm, it looks like from here.

1464
01:47:00.581 --> 01:47:02.499
There goes the big hat.

1465
01:47:05.961 --> 01:47:09.506
I've never seen a fighter<br>that concerned about his hair.

1466
01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:19.891
There's the bell for round one.

1467
01:47:21.352 --> 01:47:25.480
The fighters come in the center of the ring,<br>looking at each other.

1468
01:47:25.564 --> 01:47:29.025
Creed, the champion,<br>zipping in those left-handed jabs.

1469
01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:31.027
Right there. Bang.

1470
01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:35.865
The champ stinging the slower challenger<br>with jabs at will.

1471
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:39.953
In fact, it looks like Rocky<br>is blocking the blows with his face.

1472
01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:44.415
The champion doesn't look the best<br>he's ever been, but he's moving now.

1473
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:48.461
The champion's smiling now.<br>He's toying with him.

1474
01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:52.215
Trying to give the fans<br>their money's worth.

1475
01:47:53.884 --> 01:47:57.345
He's very clearly outclassed<br>the challenger right now.

1476
01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:03.434
He's trying to make his man miss like that.

1477
01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:07.564
The champ is just taunting him.

1478
01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:12.277
Creed dancing around.

1479
01:48:13.737 --> 01:48:15.530
I don't believe this!

1480
01:48:15.614 --> 01:48:18.032
The champ is down!

1481
01:48:24.165 --> 01:48:25.331
Creed is down!

1482
01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:27.417
What a surprise this is!

1483
01:48:28.586 --> 01:48:31.880
This is the first time the champion<br>has ever been knocked down.

1484
01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:34.174
The referee is giving him the count.

1485
01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:37.093
Six, seven, eight.

1486
01:48:37.178 --> 01:48:40.138
He appears to be all right.<br>Glassy-eyed but okay.

1487
01:48:40.472 --> 01:48:43.641
Go to the ribs!<br>Go to work, Rock!

1488
01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:45.268
Come on!

1489
01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.731
Rocky coming back out,<br>and he's like a bull in a china closet.

1490
01:48:49.815 --> 01:48:52.775
He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.

1491
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.529
The champion's coming off the floor

1492
01:48:56.614 --> 01:48:58.698
and he's trying to put him away.

1493
01:48:58.782 --> 01:49:00.325
A left, a right.

1494
01:49:00.409 --> 01:49:03.870
Combinations into the face!<br>That's the Apollo we know.

1495
01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:11.336
Now the champ is taunting Rocky<br>to come and get some more.

1496
01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.046
A left. Another.

1497
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:15.089
Another left.

1498
01:49:16.508 --> 01:49:18.301
Rocky's coming back!

1499
01:49:19.803 --> 01:49:22.680
Rocky's got him on the ropes!

1500
01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:24.974
Let's break it.

1501
01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.019
You're holding.

1502
01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:29.896
You're posing as a boxer.

1503
01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.066
There's no way we expected<br>this kind of hitting.

1504
01:49:40.658 --> 01:49:44.369
Apollo unloading a left.<br>He's got him up against the ropes.

1505
01:49:52.127 --> 01:49:56.214
They're leading him to his corner.<br>Rocky can't find his way.

1506
01:49:56.924 --> 01:49:58.299
I called it!

1507
01:49:58.384 --> 01:50:00.927
- Your nose is broke.<br>- How's it look?

1508
01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:02.512
It's an improvement.

1509
01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:05.848
Quit shucking and jiving! Stick and move!

1510
01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:09.435
Go for the ribs.<br>Don't let that bastard breathe.

1511
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.937
The guy's quick.

1512
01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:14.816
He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br>He thinks it's a damn fight.

1513
01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:17.610
Finish this bum, and let's go home.

1514
01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:20.989
Stay to the body. You're doing great!

1515
01:50:21.073 --> 01:50:24.284
Round two.<br>Creed predicted he'd win it in three.

1516
01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:27.954
Creed got knocked down in the first.<br>He came back strong.

1517
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:29.998
He's working hard.

1518
01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:33.126
A sharp left. Again, a hard right.

1519
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:35.712
Now coming in.<br>He's knocked him into the corner again.

1520
01:50:35.796 --> 01:50:38.298
The champion's got him<br>backed into the corner.

1521
01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:42.343
Pummeling him left and right,<br>his head bouncing against the ropes.

1522
01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:46.264
Balboa's taking<br>a tremendous beating here.

1523
01:50:46.348 --> 01:50:49.934
Battering him like a punching bag.<br>What's keeping him up?

1524
01:50:52.271 --> 01:50:53.730
Can't you fight?

1525
01:50:53.814 --> 01:50:57.066
Stop clowning around<br>and give the people something!

1526
01:50:57.735 --> 01:51:00.069
- Come on!<br>- He says he wants more!

1527
01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:02.947
He wants more. You folks<br>watching television around the world

1528
01:51:03.032 --> 01:51:05.074
you're watching a battle.

1529
01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:13.166
Balboa trying to fight back.<br>Oh, he tagged the champ!

1530
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:16.753
The champion is trying to get out of there,<br>but he can't do it.

1531
01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:20.715
He is being barraged with lefts and rights<br>to the head and body.

1532
01:51:20.799 --> 01:51:24.093
Balboa is tagging the champion<br>right on the kisser!

1533
01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:28.514
The referee steps in.<br>They're ready to keep going.

1534
01:51:28.932 --> 01:51:30.767
Back to your corners!

1535
01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:33.269
Come on, Creed!

1536
01:51:34.063 --> 01:51:36.272
This is gonna be a tough one.

1537
01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:33.287
- Back with a left!<br>- He got tagged!

1538
01:52:34.873 --> 01:52:37.458
The referee's wiping off the gloves.

1539
01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:44.966
Hard left and right combination!

1540
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:48.010
- What is keeping him up, Bill?<br>- I don't know.

1541
01:52:49.972 --> 01:52:53.224
He can't even get his gloves up<br>to protect himself.

1542
01:53:00.691 --> 01:53:02.733
Down! Stay down!

1543
01:53:02.818 --> 01:53:05.153
Apollo has his arms in the air!

1544
01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:17.331
Five.

1545
01:53:18.584 --> 01:53:19.709
Six.

1546
01:53:20.252 --> 01:53:21.461
Seven.

1547
01:53:21.545 --> 01:53:22.712
Eight.

1548
01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:24.213
Nine.

1549
01:53:31.096 --> 01:53:32.388
Come on!

1550
01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.641
Apollo can't believe it.

1551
01:53:52.409 --> 01:53:55.620
The champion got a left to his right ribs.

1552
01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:58.247
This has been a tremendous...

1553
01:54:04.004 --> 01:54:05.171
Okay, champ?

1554
01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:06.547
Yeah, I'm okay.

1555
01:54:06.632 --> 01:54:09.258
I may have broke my ribs.

1556
01:54:09.343 --> 01:54:11.802
I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye.

1557
01:54:11.887 --> 01:54:13.804
- Cut me.<br>- Don't wanna do it.

1558
01:54:13.889 --> 01:54:16.390
- Go ahead. Cut me.<br>- Okay.

1559
01:54:16.475 --> 01:54:18.017
Try it. Cut it.

1560
01:54:18.477 --> 01:54:20.353
Creed! Creed!

1561
01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:23.523
Oh, God.

1562
01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:26.400
You're bleeding inside.<br>I'm gonna stop the fight.

1563
01:54:26.485 --> 01:54:29.779
You ain't stopping nothing, man.

1564
01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:32.448
You stop this fight, I'll kill you!

1565
01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:35.993
- I'm going.<br>- If you wanna go.

1566
01:54:37.246 --> 01:54:39.580
You gotta give it all!

1567
01:54:39.665 --> 01:54:41.624
You gotta get him!

1568
01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:49.006
The 15th and final round.

1569
01:54:49.091 --> 01:54:52.134
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1570
01:54:57.975 --> 01:55:00.601
They look like they've been in a war.

1571
01:55:08.193 --> 01:55:11.571
A hard right.<br>The champion really tagged him.

1572
01:55:11.655 --> 01:55:15.658
Apollo clearly protecting<br>his right side, his ribs.

1573
01:55:19.037 --> 01:55:20.830
Body punches!

1574
01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:24.333
Hard lefts and rights. Look at the blood<br>coming out of his mouth!

1575
01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:26.544
He's spitting up blood now.

1576
01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:32.508
A tremendous right hand by Rocky.

1577
01:55:32.593 --> 01:55:33.968
Go for it, Rock!

1578
01:55:34.052 --> 01:55:37.054
- Listen to this crowd!<br>- Right to the ribs.

1579
01:55:37.139 --> 01:55:39.432
Another to the ribs. That left hand again.

1580
01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:42.768
Right to the jaw!<br>He's got him up against the ropes!

1581
01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:44.979
Apollo the champ...

1582
01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:51.193
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

1583
01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.362
Don't want one.

1584
01:56:03.874 --> 01:56:06.792
Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.<br>How do you feel?

1585
01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:09.378
- All right.<br>- What were you thinking about...

1586
01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:12.131
- Adrian!<br>...coming out for the 15th round?

1587
01:56:12.215 --> 01:56:13.466
Adrian!

1588
01:56:15.469 --> 01:56:16.594
Rocky!

1589
01:56:20.932 --> 01:56:22.808
- Tonight...<br>- Rocky!

1590
01:56:22.893 --> 01:56:25.895
...we have had the privilege of witnessing

1591
01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:29.607
the greatest exhibition of boxing stamina

1592
01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:31.817
in the history of the ring.

1593
01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:33.444
Adrian!

1594
01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:35.446
Rocky!

1595
01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:38.407
Ladies and gentlemen,

1596
01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:41.327
we have a split decision.

1597
01:56:42.537 --> 01:56:43.954
Judge Walker

1598
01:56:47.417 --> 01:56:48.793
for Creed!

1599
01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:52.672
Adrian!

1600
01:56:52.756 --> 01:56:56.258
- Your fans want a rematch.<br>- Ain't gonna be no rematch!

1601
01:56:58.095 --> 01:56:59.845
- Adrian!<br>- You heard him...

1602
01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:03.015
- You can't go in there!<br>- That's my friend. Let go!

1603
01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.601
- You're wrecking the jacket!<br>- Rocky!

1604
01:57:05.686 --> 01:57:08.312
- Paulie.<br>- Adrian!

1605
01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:15.194
I love you!

01:57:18.824 --> 01:57:21.367
