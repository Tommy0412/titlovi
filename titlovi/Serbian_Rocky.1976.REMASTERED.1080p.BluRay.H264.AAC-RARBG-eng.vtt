00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.824
Referee,
why don't you stop the fight?

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.083
Let's go! Let's go!

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:31.048
Come on! Get him!

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.719
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:01.204
You're waltzing.
Give the sucker some action.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.665
You're fighting like a bum.
Want some advice?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.875
Water.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.877
Cold beer here!

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.507
Should I bet the fight don't go
three rounds? You feel strong?

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.051
- Absolutely.
- Cold beer!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.054
- You want good advice?
- Mouthpiece.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.817
Come on, Rock!

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.929
All right. All right.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:46.976
Next a six-rounder
between local lightweights Kid Brooks

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.811
and Sugar Johnson.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.696
Good going, champ.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.116
- Hey.
- Say what?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.328
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.705
You're a bum.

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:11.000
You're a bum, you know that?
You're a bum!

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.864
You really got lucky tonight.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.449
Spider, here's loser's share.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.160
$40, less $15 locker and cornerman,

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:49.080
$5 shower and towel, 7 percent tax.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.165
Comes to 17.20.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.626
You fought a good fight, Spider.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.045
Balboa, you get winner's share, $65.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.008
Less $15 locker and cornerman,
$5 shower and towel and 7 percent tax.

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.552
Comes to 40.55.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.348
- When do I fight again?
- Maybe two weeks.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.310
Give me a call. The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.265
Hey, boy.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.573
You guys are getting better every year.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.325
Yeah.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.400
Hey, your old man did pretty good tonight.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.318
Why weren't you there?

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.113
You should've seen me. You guys hungry?

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:15.619
Here you go.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.916
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.131
How you doing, Moby Dick?
You miss me today?

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.428
Here you go. Say hi.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.182
If you guys could sing or dance,
I wouldn't be doing this.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.368
And this turtle food I got here, it's...

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.705
This turtle food I got here
has more flies in it...

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.707
There are more moths in it than flies.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.960
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.419
How you feeling this morning? Full of life?

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.878
Fine.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.880
How you doing, killer?

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.925
- How's the turtle food this week?
- Fine.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.636
I'm kind of aggravated.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:38.971
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.640
Ain't your fault.
You don't wanna hear about it?

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.517
I'll tell you somebody
who don't wanna hear about it.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.602
- How you doing, Gloria?
- Good.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:49.815
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies, Adrian.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.692
These moths get caught
in the turtle's throat

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.778
and they cough, and I gotta smack them
on the back of the shell

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.739
and what do you think they get?

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.365
They get what?

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.703
Come on. Shell shock.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.747
They get shell-shocked.
What do you think?

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.874
You're starting with
the bad jokes early, huh?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.501
Well, no.
Inventing jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.503
No, that wasn't no joke.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.715
Hey, how's my buddy doing today?
Yo, Butkus.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.425
Yo, Butkus!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.886
What is it?

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.017
Hey, give me a kiss.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.229
Adrian, go downstairs and clean
all the cat cages. They're a mess.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.372
You gotta pay for that turtle food,
rock head.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.708
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.652
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?
- Real good.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.695
Hey, Rock, you fighting again?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.739
- Here and there.
- We'll make some money real soon, huh?

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.825
Yeah, a million dollars.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.661
Hey, you. Where are you going?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.710
Where are you going? Where you running?

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.296
- Where you running?
- Hey! Hey!

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.924
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.343
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:42.636
I'm broke!

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.889
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb. You understand?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.809
- Please, don't...
- What's your name again?

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.646
- Bob!
- Bob. Listen, Bob.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.358
You wanna dance, you gotta pay the band.
You understand?

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.694
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.114
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.
You understand?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.867
Give me some money.
Give me some money.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.081
There's 130 here.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.125
That's it. I'm broke.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.628
Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.048
You don't have to break nothing.
Take my coat.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.217
It's worth $50, $60.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.303
Take the coat!

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.389
You know, you should've planned ahead.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.600
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.977
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb!

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.646
- Should've planned ahead.
- Gazzo don't have to know!

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.816
He won't be wise to nothing!
Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.694
Keep the coat! Keep the...

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:13.852
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.271
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.274
That's it for today.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.654
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.
He's late three weeks. I don't like it.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.073
Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.700
All right, I got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.078
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.579
- Hey.
- What?

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.499
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.417
The truck that run over your face.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.586
Relax, Buddy. Pull it over here.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:43.131
I wanna let Rocky out.
I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.864
Why didn't you break this guy's thumb?

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.242
- How do you know I didn't?
- You don't think I hear things?

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.119
Didn't I give you a job this morning?

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.080
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you break his thumb?

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:19.001
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.087
I figured... Look.
I figured if I break the guy's thumb,

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.547
he gets laid off.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.508
- He can't make money.
- Let me do the figuring.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.969
From here on in, let me do the figuring.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:33.098
These guys think we're running a charity,
they'll get off light.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.684
From here on in, do what I tell you to do,

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.269
because it's bad for my reputation.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:40.105
You understand? You got it, Rock?

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.441
I got it.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.321
How do you spell Del Rio?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.115
- Look it up in a dictionary.
- Come on!

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.410
I won't let that happen no more,
about the thumb.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.580
You know?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.416
So long, meat bag.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.546
I should've broke your thumbs!

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.328
Hey, Rock. Heard you did good last night.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.456
- Absolutely. Should've seen me.
- Shouldn't you take a rest?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.416
- No, my back is hurt.
- Your back?

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.585
My back is hurt. You deaf?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.212
No, I'm short.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.361
Hey, yo, Mike.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.406
Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.701
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.914
What you talking about?
It's been my locker for six years.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.416
Where's my gear?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.127
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.967
You put my stuff on skid row.

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:18.096
I been in that locker for six years,
and you put my stuff on skid row?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.599
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.100
Where is he?

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.644
He's outside working with Dipper.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.105
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.950
Keep your hands up.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.828
Keep your hands up. Watch the right.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.580
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.832
To the body. Attaboy.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.962
Time. Time!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.591
What do you want?

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.010
- How you feeling today?
- What?

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.137
- How you feeling?
- Are you a doctor?

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:02.224
- You have problems today?
- Never mind. What's your problem?

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:06.311
I been talking to Michael.
How come I been put out of my locker?

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.773
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.067
He's a climber.
Do you know what you are?

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.444
- You're a tomato.
- Tomato?

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.656
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.741
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.828
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won K.O. In the second.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.621
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.122
Spider Rico.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:27.874
He's a bum!

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:32.045
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.257
You got heart,
but you fight like a goddamn ape.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.552
The only thing special about you,
you never got your nose busted.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:42.347
Leave it that way. Nice and pretty
and what's left of your mind.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.141
I think I'm gonna go take a steam.
You know why?

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.894
Because I did good last night,
and you should've seen me.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.522
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me too.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.898
Hey, kid.

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:54.818
- You ever think about retiring?
- No.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.570
- You think about it.
- Yeah.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.238
All right, time.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.906
- Time!
- What?

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.117
I dig your locker, man.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.580
Dig your locker.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.958
Attaboy.

00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:42.198
Cold night.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.202
Whew! Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.000
You need some help?

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.712
There's a good game
at the Spectrum tonight.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.675
You wanna go to a basketball game?

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.597
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.102
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.022
I had that locker for six years.
It don't bother me.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.649
Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:16.983
People get the combination.

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.946
I must've had 20 bucks
taken out of there in the past 6 years.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:24.074
Don't sound like much, but it adds up.

00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:26.201
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.413
Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:33.166
Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.834
The giant worm.

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:40.215
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.133
Bird, you wanna fly me home?

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.719
You need somebody to walk you home?

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.137
- No.
- No?

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:50.767
It's a cold night.
If you got the money, take a cab.

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:53.019
Too many creeps around here.

00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:56.147
Every other block, there's a creep.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.650
You can always tell a creep.

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:02.529
Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?

00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:04.322
I'll see you later, all right?

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:08.201
None of you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.369
So,

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.497
I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:14.332
Okay? Good night, Adrian.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.126
Good night, Rocky.

00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:37.230
Don't know what happened.

00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:41.401
Hey, there, Lefty. Got a friend for you here.

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.695
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doing?

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.989
- You seen Paulie?
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.908
- Yeah.
- Hey, Rocky. What's with the eye?

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.952
- Been fighting.
- Hope you won it, at least.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.871
Oh, yeah, did real good.
You should've seen me.

00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:54.164
...heavyweight champion of the world

00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:55.915
Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.126
Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.627
Spider Rico.

00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:01.963
Jesus. Is he still around?

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:05.216
Yeah, he's doing real good.
He's doing better than you are.

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:08.970
Hey, Paulie. What, do you lock the door?
Yo, Paulie.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.057
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:13.808
Hey, yo, Paulie.

00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:18.897
Every day, every night, I pass by.
Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.648
- Forget her.
- What do you mean?

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.734
- You can do better than her.
- I don't forget nothing.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.861
Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.572
Every morning I pass by, I tell a joke.

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.741
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:32.744
- Looks?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.579
I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.956
Something wrong with my face?

00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.584
She's a freaking loser.

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.921
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.924
- Don't get mental.
- You caught me in a bad mood.

00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.843
- You're always in a bad mood.
- Adrian ain't sharp.

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.804
Adrian is a loser.

00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.264
She's pushing 30 freaking years old.

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:55.683
If she don't watch out,
she's gonna die alone.

00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:58.394
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll die alone.

00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.438
I don't see no crowd around you neither.

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.774
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.527
Come on. Let's get out of this stink.

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:09.239
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:11.741
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:14.369
Why don't you talk to him about me?

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:17.539
I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:20.208
You know? Come on.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.506
- The girl's dried up.
- Who?

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.176
My sister. If she don't start living,
her body's gonna dry up.

00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:32.637
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?

00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.598
- Come over and talk to her.
- Sure. Beer.

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:37.976
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.311
Absolutely. You got it.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.773
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:45.150
- Paulie!
- I got it.

00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:46.860
...Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green

00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:49.821
here in Philadelphia
at the fabulous Spectrum.

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.072
Larry.

00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:53.616
You're speaking now of your
much-publicized Bicentennial fight.

00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.911
Right. This is gonna be the greatest
sporting event in the country's history.

00:24:56.996 --> 00:25:00.123
A gala occurrence with me beating Green
like he committed a crime.

00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.792
Would you take a look at that guy?

00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:06.045
I mean, where are the real fighters
gonna come from? The pros.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.506
All we got today are jig clowns.

00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.967
...on January 1st.
The first major event in the country's...

00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:13.219
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:16.723
And in keeping with great events
throughout the country's history,

00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:20.810
Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking
of the Liberty Bell by cracking Green.

00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:23.396
You're calling Apollo Creed a clown?

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.440
What else? Look at him.

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:27.859
Stay in school and use your brain.

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:30.904
Be a doctor, be a lawyer,
carry a leather briefcase.

00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:34.490
Forget about sports as a profession.
Sports make you grunt and smell.

00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:38.203
- Be a thinker, not a stinker.
- Thanks a lot, champ.

00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.496
You crazy?
This man is champion of the world.

00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.291
He took his best shot and become champ.

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:45.919
What shot did you ever take?

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:49.214
Hey, Rocky,
you're not happy with your life, that's nice.

00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:52.592
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.677
No one having gone
more than 12 rounds with him...

00:25:54.762 --> 00:25:57.472
- That's right.
...and that was Jake Dale last June...

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:01.309
- Stick that up your business.
- Why you getting so insulted?

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.479
You want me to take a shot? All right.

00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:06.272
I'll take a shot.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.372
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?
- No wine, man.

00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:25.625
- Come on. Just a little.
- Buy us some Thunderbird.

00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.295
Marie, does your brother know
you're hanging out so late?

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.547
- Get lost, creep.
- Screw you, yo-yo!

00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.675
These guys teach you to talk like that?

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.636
- Stuff it!
- Don't you never say that to me.

00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.847
You stink up the neighborhood!

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.309
You know, you can...

00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:47.647
When I was your age, only one girl in
the whole neighborhood talked like that.

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.649
That was it. Just one.

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:52.902
What are you doing?
It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:54.279
I like yellow teeth!

00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.739
- It'll make your breath like garbage.
- Maybe I like garbage.

00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.658
Nobody likes garbage.

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:01.536
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth
wasn't bad looking,

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.122
but none of the guys ever took her serious.

00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.040
They never took her out
for any serious date.

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.667
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.794
They laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:12.547
After a while, you get a reputation.
You get no respect.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.966
You understand? You get no respect.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.760
I gotta use a bad word, whore.

00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:19.762
You understand? Whore.

00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:23.850
See? You use dirty words,
and maybe you end up becoming a whore.

00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:25.810
Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.271
That don't matter.

00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:31.441
You don't really have to be one.
Just act like one and that's it.

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:35.236
Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.
You understand?

00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:38.823
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.242
"Do you remember Marie?"
"No. Who was she?"

00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:43.911
"She was the little whore who hung down
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.289
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:49.876
You see, they don't remember you.
They remember the rep.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.544
You understand?

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:55.798
You got a boyfriend?
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.926
You know why?
Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:01.804
'Cause you're hanging out with them
coconuts on the corner.

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.681
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:05.516
They're lemons. Lemons.

00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:08.644
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends. You understand?

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.189
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:13.816
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:16.319
You see, it's simple mathematics.

00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:18.654
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:19.822
What was I gonna say?

00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:22.950
You hope I don't keep acting
like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:24.118
Yeah, something like that.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.328
Good night, Rocky.

00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:27.705
- Good night. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.458
- Yo.
- Screw you, creep-o!

00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:41.135
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.637
Who are you?

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.700
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.828
Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:10.456
"a severely cracked third metacarpal
in his left hand."

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.291
Damn!

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:16.421
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:18.548
Hey, it ain't just Green.

00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:21.175
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.927
We can find a solution.

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.095
Solution nothing.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:26.889
Find me another ranked contender
in a flash, Jergens.

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:28.933
Don't play games with my client.

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.602
Apollo's already done a million dollars'
worth of publicity,

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.605
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.399
He's not going to be embarrassed!

00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:38.860
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:40.903
Ernie's fighting in France that same week.

00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:43.114
Then get me Buddy Shaw.
He's ranked fifth.

00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.033
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.494
I called every
worthwhile contender.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:52.540
They all say five weeks isn't enough time
to get into shape.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.168
Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.

00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.253
They know everybody
is gonna see this fight.

00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:59.130
None of them's got
a prayer of whipping me.

00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:03.259
They're making excuses so they don't
have to be the chump who gets whipped.

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:05.970
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:09.640
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.893
and I've broken my ass over this one.

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.228
I don't know what else to do!

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:20.943
I do.

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:27.241
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight needs is a novelty.

00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.161
This is the land of opportunity, right?

00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:32.663
So, Apollo Creed, on January 1 st,

00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:35.833
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:40.838
A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

00:30:40.923 --> 00:30:42.840
And I'll tell you why.

00:30:42.925 --> 00:30:44.926
Because I'm sentimental.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.970
A lot of other people in this country
are just as sentimental

00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.848
and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creed

00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:54.060
give a local Philadelphia boy
a shot at the greatest title in the world

00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:56.479
on this country's biggest birthday.

00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:58.689
Now that's the way I see it

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:01.234
and that's the way it's gonna be.

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.027
Apollo, I like it.

00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:05.279
It's very American.

00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:08.950
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.685
- What is it?
- I wanna check this thing out.

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:39.564
You said pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:43.734
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:45.570
- Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:47.238
Yeah, I got it.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.700
Who's this girl you're going out with
tomorrow night?

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:53.035
- How'd you know?
- I know.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.247
Don't you think I hear things?
Lot of canaries flying around the docks.

00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:58.583
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:00.835
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.087
She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:07.758
Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.677
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who you calling a bum?

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.554
- Back it up, Buddy.
- I'm calling you a bum!

00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:14.932
Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:18.102
He's always in a bad mood.
You ought to count your blessings.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.854
You're still a healthy person.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.148
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours either!

00:32:22.232 --> 00:32:24.275
- Kiss my ass!
- Come out here!

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.902
Relax! Relax. My ears.

00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:29.655
Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.

00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:32.408
Look. Buddy doesn't like you.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.786
Some guys, they just hate for no reason.
Capisce?

00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:37.538
- Yeah.
- Come here.

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:42.335
Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,
you have a nice time.

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:43.669
Thanks.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.881
How'd you know her name?

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.216
You don't think I hear things?

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.302
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.845
- Remember what I told you?
- What'd you tell me?

00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:53.929
Take her to the zoo.

00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:55.973
Come on out of the car!

00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:05.733
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.194
What do you think about Billy Snow?

00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:09.487
Fouls.

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:12.823
How about Big Chuck Smith?

00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:14.992
No, he's too old and dull.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.036
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.829
No. I don't feel no heat from that name.

00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:21.082
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

00:33:22.292 --> 00:33:25.127
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.464
This is what I'm looking for.

00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.758
The Italian Stallion.

00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:33.594
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:36.055
Look, it's the name, man.

00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:38.140
The Italian Stallion.

00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:40.726
The media will eat it up.

00:33:40.811 --> 00:33:43.646
Who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.483
What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendants?

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.026
He's a southpaw.

00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:50.861
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.988
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothing.

00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:54.990
I'll drop him in three.

00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.870
Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.

00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.791
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

00:34:04.126 --> 00:34:06.085
What are you doing with that bat?

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:07.837
I used to be deadly at stickball.

00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.798
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- She's very excited.

00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:13.217
- Look at these swollen hands.
- Yeah.

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:16.721
The joints from carrying meat
in and out of the freezer.

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:20.057
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

00:34:20.142 --> 00:34:22.059
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

00:34:22.144 --> 00:34:24.562
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big? Small?

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:27.982
Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.110
Nothing bothers me.
I'd make a great collector.

00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:33.195
Busting bones don't bother me.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.656
Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?

00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:38.743
Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job.

00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.369
You got a match?

00:34:40.454 --> 00:34:42.413
Go to him for me. As a favor.

00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:45.249
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:48.794
was when they had a two-dollar special
at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.380
Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.

00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:03.601
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.356
Will you forget about Gazzo?

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.484
I don't ask nobody twice.

00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:13.527
Don't ask nobody twice.

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.951
You're sure your sister knows I'm coming?

00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.078
Yeah. She's very excited.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.542
Paulie, you're late.

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.836
You call the hospital?

00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.048
She calls the hospital
if I'm ten minutes late.

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.675
Yo, how you doing?

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.095
I told you, she's very excited.

00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:45.017
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.685
I'm not ready for this.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.188
Would it make a difference
if you were?

00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:51.732
- He's taking you out.
- No, I can't.

00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.820
I want you out of the kitchen
right now.

00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:57.738
I won't.

00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:05.162
I want you out of here instamatically!

00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:07.832
I'm sick of seeing you
hanging around like a freaking spider.

00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:10.084
Go out and live. Enjoy life!

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:11.919
I can't go!

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.921
Don't get wise with me now.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.714
I'm tired of you being a loser.

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:18.008
Don't call me that, Paulie!

00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:20.970
Apollo Creed says
he'll be shopping for another victim

00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:24.849
to fill Green's vacancy
for the Bicentennial championship fight...

00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:26.600
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:27.977
How do you know I didn't?

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:30.896
I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!

00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.106
Why?

00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:36.569
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:39.280
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.788
Turkey in the oven.

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:58.591
You want the bird?
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.634
Aw, Paulie!

00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.638
I want you out of here!
Get out of the house!

00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.433
Go out and enjoy your freaking life!

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:13.314
You hungry, Rock?

00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:23.657
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better
forget all this, you know?

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:27.286
Forget nothing. Go ahead.
Tell her something funny.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.539
Ain't nothing to talk about.
She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

00:37:30.624 --> 00:37:33.417
You can do funny things.
You wanna go out with my sister?

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.002
- Yeah.
- Well...

00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.841
I don't know what to say.

00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.134
Funny.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.856
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:57.900
Rocky, you know?

00:37:58.568 --> 00:37:59.818
Listen,

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.533
I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't
never talked to no door before.

00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:10.955
What do I say to a door?
We better forget this.

00:38:11.373 --> 00:38:12.456
You're doing fine.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.833
I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.

00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.961
Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.

00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.213
I know all about these things.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.048
I feel like a jerk.

00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:29.473
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:34.186
Listen, I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.355
But could you do me a favor?

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:39.400
I ain't got nobody
to spend Thanksgiving with.

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.903
So, how about maybe you and I

00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:44.822
go out together, get something to eat.

00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:47.449
Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:49.284
Would you like to...

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:53.914
Would you like to, maybe,
you and me go out together?

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.625
What do you think? Would you like to?

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.841
We're gonna have a good time.

00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:06.385
We'll have a real good time.

00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:12.725
Thanks for the bird.

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:19.273
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:34.038
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:36.081
Adrian, come on.
You're letting the heat out.

00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.500
Who pays the bills around here?

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.217
Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,
you know?

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:50.804
But it was Thanksgiving.

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.723
What?

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:54.767
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you.

00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.186
But to me it's Thursday, right?

00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:24.213
- It looks kind of quiet.
- I think it's closed.

00:40:24.297 --> 00:40:27.424
No, I think we're just early
or something like that.

00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.677
- We're closed.
- What?

00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.931
- I said we're closed.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:37.392
I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:39.394
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:43.440
Are you closed to the general public,
or are you just closed to everybody?

00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:47.694
It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:50.072
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:52.616
So do me a favor and not stay here.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.286
- Could you do me a favor?
- Come on. We're not operating.

00:40:56.538 --> 00:40:59.373
Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.959
Doctors say she should go out
and exercise.

00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:04.211
Ice-skating's probably the best thing.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.546
So what do you want from me?

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.464
Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.

00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:09.133
You can see she ain't feeling too good.

00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:12.261
If you can let her on the ice
for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.

00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:14.138
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:16.390
Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:18.600
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:20.727
All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.564
You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:27.442
Give her the blades.

00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:29.486
Aren't you skating?

00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.572
No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.949
That's when I started fighting.

00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:36.910
Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,
you know?

00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:40.622
You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?

00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:43.917
Like I was saying
before on the way over here,

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:47.171
fighting used to be tops with me,
but no more.

00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:49.756
All I wanted to do out of fighting
was prove I was no bum,

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.217
that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:55.345
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't crying about it.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.681
I still fight. I do it like a hobby.

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.892
The trouble is I'm a southpaw.

00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:02.936
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.355
A southpaw throws your timing off.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.774
It throws other guys' timing off,
makes them look awkward.

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.401
Nobody wants to look awkward.

00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:12.696
- You know where "southpaw" came from?
- Nine minutes!

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.824
A long time ago, there was this guy,
maybe a couple hundred years ago,

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:19.369
he was fighting in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia.

00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:23.373
His arm... He was left-handed.
His arm was facing towards New Jersey.

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:27.336
And that's south. So naturally
they called him "south paw." You see?

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.714
Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.

00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:33.008
Southpaw. You know what I mean?

00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:36.637
Things probably worked out for the best,
don't you think?

00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.389
Never got a chance
because you're left-handed, huh?

00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:41.558
That's absolutely true, you know?

00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:42.893
Watch out.

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:47.940
Ah! Ah! I just dislocated my finger.

00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:49.816
Ah! Look at that.

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:52.361
Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.

00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:54.821
See? I had it... It's an old wound.

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:57.115
You see that? Look. See?

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.659
Nothing. It bends like that.

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:01.703
I originally done it... Push the button.
Bong. It works.

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:04.665
- It ain't your fault. Look.
- Seven minutes!

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:08.418
I originally done it...
I carry pictures of all my fights.

00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:11.255
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight.

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.383
Baby's about the size of an
airplane. I broke both hands on his face.

00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:17.803
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think?

00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:19.263
Real nice.

00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:23.100
Come on. You having a good time?

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.727
You can see I ain't too graceful.

00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:30.190
I don't move well, but I can really swat.
I can really hit hard.

00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:33.944
But I'm a southpaw,
and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.

00:43:39.158 --> 00:43:41.910
You know how I got started in fighting?

00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:42.995
No.

00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.789
Am I talking too loud?

00:43:46.082 --> 00:43:47.624
Three minutes!

00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:52.296
My father, he's a...
My old man, he was never too smart.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.464
He says to me,
"You weren't born with much of a brain,

00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:57.050
"so you better start using your body."

00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:59.052
So I become a fighter.

00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.471
You know what I mean?

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:03.390
Why you laughing?

00:44:04.726 --> 00:44:07.644
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:09.980
What did she say the opposite?

00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.899
She said,
"You weren't born with much of a body,

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:14.693
"so you better develop your brain."

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:17.571
- Did she say that?
- Yo, time!

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:21.742
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:26.371
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:27.456
Hey, yo.

00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.791
Don't fall!

00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:33.462
That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.

00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:34.796
You like the way I skate?

00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:37.924
Last fight I had,
I had with this guy named Spider Rico.

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.719
He busted my head up there.
You see that scar?

00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:43.805
I'll tell you,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:56.234
You know,
some people are very shy by nature.

00:44:57.153 --> 00:44:58.528
I suppose.

00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:04.326
I say you're very shy by nature, you know?

00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:06.953
I suppose.

00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:11.375
The bum from the dark.

00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:13.126
Get a job, you bum!

00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:16.838
Some people think
that being shy is a disease,

00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.882
but it don't bother me none.

00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:20.884
Don't bother me either.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.346
So why'd I bother bringing it up?

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.598
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.893
I think we make
a sharp couple of coconuts.

00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.813
I'm dumb and you're shy.
What do you think?

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.652
I don't understand
why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:44.282
You gotta be a moron to wanna
be a fighter, you know what I mean?

00:45:44.826 --> 00:45:48.286
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:51.832
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum.

00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:54.209
But I'll tell you something.

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:57.629
Worst thing about fighting
is the morning after.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:59.089
- You know?
- Morning after.

00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:01.091
Yeah, the morning after a fight,

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.718
you're like a large wound,
you know what I mean?

00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:05.846
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.599
I feel like calling a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:11.601
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.

00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:14.563
Your face is busted up.
Your hands are swollen.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.732
Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.
Look at that nose.

00:46:17.817 --> 00:46:20.569
You see that nose?
That nose ain't never been broken.

00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:22.946
I had guys busting on it.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.116
I had guys chewing on it,
twisting and punching it.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.784
I mean, whack, boom.

00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:30.370
These guys are hitting my nose
all the time.

00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.414
Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.082
That's rare.

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:37.210
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.256
'Cause you can't sing and dance?

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:44.050
Yeah, something like that.

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:46.261
Hey, you wanna come inside?

00:46:48.598 --> 00:46:49.806
No, I gotta go.

00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.892
Hey, come on. I got some animals.

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.352
I got these very rare animals inside.

00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:56.021
Come on in.

00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.564
No, I gotta go.

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:00.484
I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.

00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:02.194
Come on.

00:47:02.278 --> 00:47:04.029
No, I gotta go.

00:47:04.113 --> 00:47:07.782
Look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust or what?

00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:12.245
Is it? They ought to stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.414
Come on in.

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:21.421
Yo, come on.

00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:43.360
Click.

00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:50.784
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.202
No.

00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.995
I got some things in there.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.957
If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.

00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.292
Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?

00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:00.585
No?

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.463
I got some chocolate in there. No?

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.057
Hot in here, you know?

00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.270
I could go for some music.

00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.318
Yo, Adrian.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.572
These are the exotic animals
I was telling you about.

00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.740
These are my friends, Cuff and Link.

00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:33.618
- I sold them to you.
- I know you sold them to me.

00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:36.204
Remember you were working
at that pet shop?

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:39.749
First day you was there, and I came in
and bought both these animals?

00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:40.917
I remember that.

00:48:41.002 --> 00:48:44.754
I bought this bowl
and the animals themselves.

00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:47.424
Some food,
the marbles that go on the bottom there.

00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:49.426
Remember that mountain?

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.722
I had to get rid of that mountain.
They kept fall over and flipping.

00:48:57.184 --> 00:49:00.020
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:04.566
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

00:49:06.736 --> 00:49:09.863
There's big bugs in there.
It's safer over here.

00:49:12.408 --> 00:49:14.200
You wanna sit down?

00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:22.417
These your parents?

00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.753
Yeah, that's both of them there.

00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:27.464
- Is this you?
- Yeah. I was eight years old.

00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:30.717
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:36.056
Come on over.
Make yourself comfortable. Relax.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.812
Do you have a phone?

00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:44.773
No, I had it pulled.

00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:46.650
'Cause people calling all the time,

00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:49.486
and who needs the aggravation, right?

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.071
Interruptions.

00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:53.156
Who'd you wanna call?

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.992
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:57.911
Why?

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.164
I think he might be worried.

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:04.376
I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.089
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!

00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:11.800
I'll call you back later! See you!

00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.684
You don't like the room, do you?

00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.770
- It's fine.
- It's only temporary.

00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.939
It's not that.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.905
What's the problem? You don't like me?

00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.199
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:39.035
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:43.623
I don't belong here.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.585
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:51.715
I don't know you well enough.

00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:55.135
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.806
Well, they're all the same, you know?

00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:07.522
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.942
I don't feel comfortable.

00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:13.987
Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:17.907
I should go.

00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:20.326
Don't go, please. Don't go.

00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.663
Don't go.

00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:28.877
Do me a favor.

00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.170
What?

00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:32.172
Take off these glasses.

00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:38.136
You have nice eyes, you know?

00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:41.765
Do me another favor?

00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:45.143
Why don't you take off that hat?

00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:53.693
I always knew you was pretty.

00:51:55.196 --> 00:51:57.864
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

00:52:01.202 --> 00:52:03.036
I ain't teasing you.

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:06.706
I just wanna... I wanna kiss you.

00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:12.378
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't wanna,

00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:14.297
but I wanna kiss you.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.706
- Heard you had a fight coming up.
- Next month.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.541
January 27, right?

00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.585
That's good. Come down to the gym.

00:53:33.669 --> 00:53:35.962
We'll get you in shape.
How's your weight?

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.882
- 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doing?

00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:41.175
Mick was looking for you up there, man.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.469
- For me? You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.680
He's looking for you.
Get up there and see him.

00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:48.182
- He wanted me?
- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?

00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:50.184
- Yeah.
- All right. Go on, babe.

00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.326
You got something for me?

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.245
Yeah, there was some guy
from Miles Jergens looking for you.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.790
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed. There's the card.

00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:14.584
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:17.921
They're probably looking
for sparring partners for Creed.

00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.506
I said that before, you dumb Dago!

00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:25.219
I been coming here for six years,
and six years you been sticking it to me.

00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:27.805
- How come?
- You don't wanna know!

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.641
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:31.768
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know now!

00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.895
Okay, I'm gonna tell you!

00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:38.024
You had the talent to become
a good fighter, and instead of that,

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:42.236
you became a leg breaker
for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:44.322
It's a living.

00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.240
It's a waste of life!

00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:06.636
Yes. May I help you?

00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:14.435
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.397
Mr. Jergens's expecting you.
Just a moment.

00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:24.946
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:26.614
Fine.

00:55:27.408 --> 00:55:29.867
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

00:55:29.952 --> 00:55:32.412
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.584
Mr. Balboa.

00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:41.087
How are you? George Jergens.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.797
Take a chair, please.

00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:44.090
Thanks.

00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:47.343
Mr. Balboa.

00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:49.762
Call me Rocky.

00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:51.889
Rocky, you got any representation?

00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:53.474
You have a manager?

00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:54.976
No, just me.

00:55:56.603 --> 00:56:00.440
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:04.027
- About sparring?
- Beg your pardon?

00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:08.614
I know you're looking for
sparring partners, and I'm very available.

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.616
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely.

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:12.201
Sparring with the champ
would be an honor,

00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:13.536
and you know what, Mr. Jergens?

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.496
- What?
- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:17.707
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.126
You don't understand me, Rocky.

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:22.462
My proposition's this.

00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:25.673
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

00:56:25.758 --> 00:56:28.468
for the world heavyweight championship?

00:56:33.057 --> 00:56:34.140
No.

00:56:34.308 --> 00:56:35.850
Listen, Rocky.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.811
Apollo's seen you fight.

00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.230
He likes you.

00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:43.066
He wants to fight you.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.901
Well, it's just that, you see,

00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:48.154
I fight in clubs, you know,
and I'm really a ham-and-egger.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.073
This guy, he's the best, and

00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.826
it wouldn't be such a good fight,
but thank you very much.

00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:55.745
I appreciate it.

00:56:55.829 --> 00:57:00.166
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:02.668
Yeah.

00:57:03.545 --> 00:57:05.254
Apollo Creed does,

00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:07.590
and he's gonna prove it to the whole world

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:10.384
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:12.887
And that unknown is you.

00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.473
He picked you, Rocky.

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:18.935
It's the chance of a lifetime.

00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:22.021
You can't pass it by.

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.190
What do you say?

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.864
All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.

00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:33.783
We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.

00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:36.410
Apollo, how do you like
the City of Brotherly Love?

00:57:36.495 --> 00:57:39.914
Well, just being in Philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic.

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:42.708
Beautiful people in a beautiful city
coming up to me on the street,

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:43.960
wishing me the best.

00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:46.796
I love my Philadelphia brothers,
and I'm proud to be an American.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.422
Apollo? Champ?

00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:52.343
Why did you agree to fight a man
who has virtually no chance of winning?

00:57:52.427 --> 00:57:54.720
If history proves one thing,

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:58.558
American history proves that
everybody's got a chance to win.

00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:01.769
Didn't you guys ever hear
of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?

00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:03.354
Apollo?

00:58:03.438 --> 00:58:05.982
It is a coincidence
that you're fighting a white man

00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.025
on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:11.320
I don't know. Is it a coincidence
that he's fighting a black man

00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:13.739
on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?

00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.825
- Right on, Apollo!
- Tell the truth, brother!

00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:18.494
Listen, Apollo.
How do you feel about your challenger?

00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:21.330
How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.124
My main man.

00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:25.877
- Rocky, ain't you Italian?
- Yeah, I'm Italian.

00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.670
Now what does that mean?

00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:30.631
That means, if he can't fight,
I'll bet he can cook.

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.886
Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.387
Paulie.

00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:39.724
Rocky, how do you expect
to fight Apollo Creed?

00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:42.476
Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.

00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.228
I guess I'll have to do the best I can.

00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:46.981
Tell me, Rocky, just between us,

00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:50.109
where did you get
the name "Italian Stallion"?

00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:54.614
Oh, I invented that about eight years ago
when I was eating dinner.

00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:59.493
Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.037
Any comment?

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.167
- You got no comment, Rocky, right?
- No.

00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:07.710
- Thank you, Rocky.
- Wait a minute.

00:59:07.794 --> 00:59:10.713
I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?

00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:12.924
Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.

00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.761
You believe all this?
Microphones and all that stuff.

00:59:16.845 --> 00:59:17.970
You didn't.

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:20.389
- Thank you, Rocky.
- Who you pushing, man?

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:22.808
- Smack you in the mouth!
- Thank you, Rocky.

00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:24.769
Don't it matter he making you out a fool?

00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:26.479
I'd break his lips.

00:59:26.605 --> 00:59:30.191
- He's taking cheap shots.
- Don't bother me none.

00:59:30.275 --> 00:59:35.071
Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.447
Help what?

00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:37.740
You know,

00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:39.742
keep you living the clean life.

00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:42.078
I do okay, you know.

00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:44.121
You need someone
to help with the exercise

00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:48.084
and someone standing by with a towel
or running errands?

00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.920
Hey, yo, Paulie,
who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.

00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:53.589
So I just think I'm gonna train myself,
you know?

00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:55.800
Without such good people around
to help you,

00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:58.344
you don't have such a good chance.

00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.055
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.640
That so?

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:06.686
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.689
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.446
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:21.325
You looking to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freaking life!

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.078
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.746
Did I say something wrong?

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.581
You didn't say nothing. It's all right.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.667
That's right! You didn't say nothing!

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.335
Nothing at all!

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.714
I gotta go.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.259
Where are the freaking pretzels?

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.264
I'd like to have a pretzel.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.474
Hey, we ain't got any beer?

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:49.520
I thought you were supposed to
pick up some beer!

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.947
How'd you like hearing your name
on TV tonight?

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.200
I was shocked.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.702
Why'd you do that?

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.537
You're putting me on, right?

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.039
Absolutely.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.542
- What time should I expect you?
- About 7:00.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.586
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:34.565
You know how I said
that stuff on TV didn't bother me?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:35.941
Yeah.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.820
It did.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:54.043
Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.462
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.297
I got a few dollars.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.633
A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.803
- What's this?
- $500. Don't worry about it.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.931
You know, you ain't never had any luck,

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:09.517
but I think this time Lady Luck
may be in your corner.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.561
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.563
Thanks for the money, Tony.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.733
It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.777
- Wait a minute.
- What?

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.987
You're in training. Come on.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.789
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.917
You gonna show up at the fight?

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.293
Ringside.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.172
I'll see you.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.459
Yeah.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.551
Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.928
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:30.139
Hey, it's a nice place here.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.726
Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.355
that what happened to you is freak luck.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.357
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true?

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.985
Look at the other guys.
They're good fighters, right?

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.738
They're colorful. They got good records.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.157
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.161
But you, you got a shot at the title!

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:54.705
Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.333
- Sure is. Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:02.004
- What the hell are those?
- Domestic turtles.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.632
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:05.925
The rest are marbles.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.385
Yeah? They make good soup.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.262
Anyway.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.224
Look, I'm here to warn you.

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:17.853
You gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.689
Because, like the Bible says,

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.942
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.152
Yeah. All right.

01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:27.154
You thought of that, huh?

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:30.658
Well, what you need is a manager.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.702
A manager. Listen to me.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.498
I know, because I been in this racket
for 50 years.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.876
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. I've seen it all.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:44.255
- All of it. You know what I done?
- What?

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.340
I have done it all.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:50.219
You should've seen me when
I knocked Ginny Russell out of the ring.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.221
Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.306
September 14, 1923,

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.727
and it was the same night
that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:01.230
So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.232
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:07.152
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.821
I had nothing.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.575
I wanna show you something.
I want you to look at my face.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.995
Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.539
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:22.042
You know I had my nose busted 17 times.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:26.714
The last time
was in that fight with Sailor Mike.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.717
I got that clipping here.
It was a good fight.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.719
Wanna read that?

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.929
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:37.516
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:46.900
You kind of remind me of the Rock,
you know that?

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.028
- You really think so?
- That's right.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.489
You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:56.201
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.749
Anyway.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.918
You know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:11.175
I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.385
It's no good for you.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.846
If you don't mind my saying.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.140
Anyway, you know,
when I started in this racket,

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.476
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.978
For $10, you got to
tear somebody's throat out.

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:25.314
But I never had no management.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.652
One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.695
he put a nail right there.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.114
- In his thumb.
- In the thumb of the glove.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:39.328
He punched so many holes in my face,
I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.664
Can you imagine that?

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.334
Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.169
I want you to look at something.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.880
Look at that. That's the way I looked

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.925
before these guys got at me.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.762
That's nice. You didn't take very good care
of the picture, though.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:07:00.057
Well, I never had no management.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.351
That's the trouble,
but now I got all this knowledge.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.187
I got it up here.
Now I wanna give it to you.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.981
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:11.276
I wanna make sure that what happened
to me doesn't happen to you.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.153
You know what I mean?

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.030
Mick, the fight's set.

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:17.741
Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.201
You follow that?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.537
Fight's set. I don't need no manager.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.956
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.417
I got pain and I got experience.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.044
I got pain and I got experience too.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.171
Listen, kid.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.881
Hey, Mick.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:35.592
I needed your help
about 10 years ago, right?

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:38.679
Ten years ago. You never helped me none.
You didn't care.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.597
If you wanted help...

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:45.227
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.938
I asked, but you never heard nothing!

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.232
Well, I...

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.862
I know I...

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.613
I'm 76 years old.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.536
And...

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.491
Took you long enough to get here.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.410
Took 10 years to come to my house.

01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:45.496
You don't like my house?

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.790
My house stink?

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.918
That's right, it stinks!

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.378
I didn't ask no favors from you!

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.258
Talk about your prime.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.677
What about my prime, Mick?

01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:02.888
At least you had a prime!

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.808
I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.894
Legs are going, everything is going.
Nobody's giving me nothing.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.146
Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.732
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:17.402
I'm gonna go fight that big fight
and I'm gonna get that!

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.571
I'm gonna get that!

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.908
And you wanna be ringside and see?

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.035
Do you? You wanna help me out?

01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:27.871
Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.957
Legs ain't working, nothing's working.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.501
Think I'll go and fight the champ.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.753
Yeah, I'll fight him.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.091
Get my face kicked in.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.511
And you come around here.
You wanna move in with me?

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.805
Come on in. It's a nice house!

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.141
Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.436
This whole place stinks.

01:09:51.896 --> 01:09:53.772
You wanna help me out?

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:57.985
Well, help me out! Come on. Help me out.
I'm standing here!

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.756
It's only about
28 degrees. We'll check that forecast.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.759
I feel very mischievous, very weird, very...

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.346
I got vinyl seats in my car.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.515
When I hit those seats this morning,
I just went, "Whoo!"

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.853
I figure if I'm up, everybody
in the Delaware Valley should be up.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.271
You agree with me?

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:20.192
At three minutes past 4:00 in the morning,
what else you gonna do?

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:22.861
Hello?

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:26.490
Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.
This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.784
- How are you this morning?
- What?

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:32.788
You have a lot of nerve
calling me at this hour of the morning!

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.164
Good-bye!

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.972
Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,
and it's a good morning.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.683
I tell you, I need someone
to snuggle with. 28 degrees.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.810
It's cold out there. We deserve it.

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:57.354
We've been getting away with murder
the last couple of weeks.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.523
Our high today could be...

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:02.484
Tonight we're back down
in the 20-degree range.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.069
A little colder in the suburbs.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.322
Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,
we may hit 40.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.366
But it's 28. It's awfully chilly.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.202
Make sure you have it bundled up
before you bring it out.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.595
Come on.

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:39.141
It stinks in here, you know?

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.059
Yeah. I know.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.063
Did you kill all these things?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.607
No, across the street.

01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:52.404
It's like an animal morgue.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:54.656
It's a little cold in here, ain't it?

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.907
Yeah.

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.581
Who killed all these things?

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.666
Are you crazy, Paulie?

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.002
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on a hook.

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:09.296
Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.173
Don't get excited. I know that.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:15.177
That's why I wanted you to talk to him
about me and the collecting job.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.762
I can get me out of this stinking freezer.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.850
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Keep this job. You eat better.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.311
Moo.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.022
Does it ever snow in here?

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.985
You and my sister,
how you getting along together?

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:34.571
How do you think?

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.741
I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.118
About what?

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.037
What's happening?

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.539
You really like her?

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.291
Sure, I like her.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.046
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.883
I don't know. Fills gaps, I guess.

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:57.135
What's "gaps"?

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:01.473
I don't know. She's got gaps.
I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:05.560
You balling her?

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:06.978
Hey.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.482
You don't talk dirty about your sister.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.444
Are you screwing my sister?

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:20.367
You see?
That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.787
Because you got a big mouth.
You just talk too much.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.707
- It's cold in here. I'm going home.
- Cold in here?

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.376
It is cold in here!

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.878
It stinks in here, and you stink!

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.492
You're breaking the ribs.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:25.890
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:30.270
I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.243
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.581
Your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.927
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, okay?

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:05.263
- I'm gonna just sit here.
- You sure?

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:06.765
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.313
Hey, come on. No fooling around, all right?

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:14.981
I'm tired.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.817
Adrian, I'm serious now.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.778
There's no fooling around during training.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.613
I wanna stay strong.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.783
- You're not kidding.
- No, I ain't kidding.

01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:29.746
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.540
Why don't you just make the meat, okay?

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:36.461
Okay, I'll make the meat.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.948
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:06.991
Hey.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.608
Underneath! Underneath!
Knock him out! Come on!

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.777
Hold it. Hold it, Rock!

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:46.865
You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.867
Let's try this. Take this string.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.535
Tie it to both ankles.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.705
- Leave about two feet of slack.
- I never had good footwork.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.374
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.960
Marciano had the same problem

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.212
and this string cured it.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:06.634
If you can move and hit without
breaking the string, you got balance!

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.970
You become a dangerous person.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.055
- You follow me?
- Looking good, Rock.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.183
- Thanks.
- Let's go. That's it.

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:15.185
- Underneath it.
- Hey, Rock.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.353
- What?
- How about an autograph?

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:18.855
Get out of here!

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.733
Don't interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.068
Move your little chicken asses out.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:28.406
Hey, listen, kid.
You lay off that pet shop dame.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.159
Women weaken legs.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.704
Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.706
Then let her train you!

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.294
Okay, no more fooling around.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.046
Okay. Now hit it.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.966
Women weaken legs, huh?

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.264
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.276
You look great.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.279
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.949
Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreak.

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.826
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts the way you're looking.

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:14.953
Very sharp.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.664
I got another surprise for you.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:18.790
What?

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:22.085
Butkus! Hey, Butkus.

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.087
Come here, kid.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.548
To keep you company when you run.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.556
Come in and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.558
Gloria says he's yours if you want him.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:39.394
Do I want him? What's he eat?

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.354
He eats little turtles.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:07.755
What's that, Butkus?

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.882
Whose truck is this? Come on.

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.846
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:18.433
You got... Need exposure.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:20.768
- Don't breathe on me.
- That's the big time.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.437
Don't I know about these things?

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.731
You don't know nothing.
What do they want from me?

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.441
To watch you train.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:29.277
What is the matter with you?
This is supposed to be private.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:31.779
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You ain't doing me no favors!

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.781
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.825
You'll make me look bad
in front of your sis...

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:38.202
See this cigar?
I'm gonna stick it in your ear.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.414
Don't do these things to me.
You should've called me.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.833
Leave a message. Don't do that.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.628
My sister really likes you.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:50.131
I'm gonna kill you one of these days!

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.466
Come on.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.301
- Baby!
- Baby.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:57.639
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.641
Hello there. Rocky Balboa.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.643
We wanna get a brief interview with you.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.561
- What about me?
- What about you?

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:05.980
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Stand behind it.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:08.066
Settle yourself down. Relax.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.985
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.655
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.531
Talk to the folks at home.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:17.659
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.370
This isn't an everyday thing.
Jimmy, you guys ready?

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.580
Let's roll it. Rocky, turn around here.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.499
Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.542
No, I won't do that. Just relax.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:30.088
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.839
The reason we're standing in this...

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.425
The meat guy's sticking
his face in.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.594
Let's try it again, Rocky.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.473
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.101
The reason we're standing
in this refrigerated box

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:46.354
is that Mr. Balboa
has an unusual method of training.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.941
In a moment, he'll demonstrate that
for the viewing audience at home.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.611
But first, Rocky,
how did you come to train in an icebox?

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:57.031
Well, my friend, the guy over there,

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:59.992
he let me in one day,
and I hit the beef here and liked it,

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:03.454
and since I've become a challenger,
the owner don't mind that I come in.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:07.417
Is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.460
No, I think I invented it.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.255
- Would you give us a demonstration?
- Confirm the reservation

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:15.800
for my people at ringside,
and fly my barber to Philly.

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:22.265
How much is being channeled
into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.642
- 300,000.
- Make it 450.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.145
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.981
and make sure we get a picture of it
for all the newspapers.

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:33.109
Do you want to run the 15 radio spots
in the Midwest?

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.778
You can spend your money better
in Canadian publicity.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:38.573
By the way, Apollo,
I've got friends in Toronto

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.616
who can get you a good tax break.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.869
George, I like your friends.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:55.256
Hey, Champ. You ought to come
look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:59.093
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.345
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:04.056
Certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:07.351
After the fight,
I may retire and run for emperor.

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:24.202
Diana Lewis in the meat house

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.746
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:15.169
And he called the reporters?

01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:17.839
Yeah.
Threw my training schedule off.

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:20.049
Don't be mad at him. He's trying to help.

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:21.968
Adrian, I ain't mad,

01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:25.263
it's just that when reporters are
around, I get out of joint

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:28.641
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:32.019
And Paulie keeps asking me
for a job all the time

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:34.856
but he don't know nothing about fighting.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.441
Are you gonna say anything to him?

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:41.696
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:49.245
I don't want nothing from you.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:53.958
This ain't no charity case.
Get out of my house.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.043
It's not just your house.

01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:59.005
You're no friend no more.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.466
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.844
Both of you get out of my house!

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.890
It's cold outside, Paulie.

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:20.985
I don't want you messing her

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.613
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:25.489
Yeah? Come on! You wanna hit on me?

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.410
Come on! I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for you.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:32.830
Stop it!

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:36.208
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:40.838
Now you're a big shot fighter, you
don't even throw a crumb to your friend.

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:43.132
When I go and get your meat
every morning!

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.760
You forgot that?
And then I even give you my sister too!

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:48.471
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:51.223
A pig gets you the best?

01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:55.227
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:57.730
You can't live by yourself!

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:01.776
I put you two together,
and don't you forget it!

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.277
You owe me!

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:07.907
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.409
You're supposed to be good to me!

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:13.996
What do I owe you, Paulie?

01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:15.706
I treat you good!

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:19.168
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:22.546
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothing!

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:25.758
And you made me feel like a loser!

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.594
I'm not a loser!

01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:30.471
- You're busted!
- What?

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.390
You're not a virgin!

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.101
You let a man take down your pants!

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:36.644
She's busted!

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.816
I can't haul meat no more!

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.056
You want a roommate?

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.354
Absolutely.

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:24.525
Okay, now
when you walk into the ring

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:27.361
with the number one
heavyweight of the world

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.071
you'll be ready, won't you?

01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:32.575
Why? Because I waited for 50 years

01:29:32.659 --> 01:29:34.326
to make you ready.

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:36.829
You'll be able to spit nails, kid!

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:39.540
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.500
and you're gonna crap thunder!

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:44.336
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:45.713
Yo, Mickey.

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:47.882
Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.

01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:51.052
I want you to meet our cut man here.
Al Salvani.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:53.095
- Take a look at his eye.
- How you doing, Al?

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.598
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. Seen worse.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:58.517
- You ain't so bad yourself.
- Cover up. Things will be okay.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:29:59.769
You cover up.

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:01.604
Go and take a shower.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.148
Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.235
You covered that Whitmore fight?

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.072
- That's why he won.
- Listen. We got a winner here.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:15.242
We got a chance. He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:18.162
You just stand by. We're gonna win.

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:27.671
Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.008
Okay you talk to me? Sure.

01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:34.637
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:37.389
My name? How's that?

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:40.184
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.522
What do you know about advertising?

01:30:47.818 --> 01:30:50.736
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, okay?

01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:52.822
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.325
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:33.505
You're gonna kill him!

01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:27.888
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:31.433
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.644
What do you mean?

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:36.647
I'm wearing white pants with a red stripe.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:42.903
It doesn't really matter, does it?

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:45.823
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:48.909
Try to get some rest, kid.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.120
Good night.

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:24.004
I can't do it.

01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:28.175
What?

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.928
I can't beat him.

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:33.764
Apollo?

01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:35.641
Yeah.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.978
I been out there, walking around, thinking.

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:45.150
Who am I kidding?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:52.366
What are we gonna do?

01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:05.379
I don't know.

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.470
You worked so hard.

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.600
Yeah, it don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

01:38:20.937 --> 01:38:22.479
Don't say that.

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:25.524
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

01:38:25.608 --> 01:38:27.109
I was nobody.

01:38:28.987 --> 01:38:31.697
But that don't matter either, you know?

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.658
'Cause I was thinking,

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.829
it really don't matter if I lose this fight.

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:44.501
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head either.

01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.589
'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:56.346
Nobody's ever gone the distance
with Creed,

01:38:57.223 --> 01:38:59.474
and if I can go that distance,

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.854
and that bell rings, and I'm still standing,

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:12.529
I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, see,

01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:17.868
that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

01:40:25.395 --> 01:40:27.187
Time, kid. Let's go.

01:40:30.233 --> 01:40:32.150
I'll wait for you here.

01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:37.280
How about I wait here and you fight, huh?

01:40:38.116 --> 01:40:41.243
You're looking very great today,
you know that?

01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:46.289
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.127
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.212
Good luck.

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:56.299
Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:57.801
Good luck.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.553
Don't leave town.

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:05.559
I'd like you to meet
my colleague, Stu Nahan.

01:41:05.643 --> 01:41:07.018
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:09.813
The electricity is all over the place tonight,
as Rocky Balboa...

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.567
What is that?

01:41:13.651 --> 01:41:15.986
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.697
- I'm doing it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

01:41:18.781 --> 01:41:20.657
Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.

01:41:20.742 --> 01:41:21.992
Shrewd.

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:25.245
The story about tonight's fight,
their difference in style,

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:27.581
you can quote
a recent sports magazine which said,

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:29.708
it could be
"the caveman against the cavalier."

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.668
I notice a buzzing in the background.

01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:34.337
Could be the challenger
is getting ready to get into the ring.

01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.590
Rocky, look at my date.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.717
- Cost me $200.
- $250.

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.427
I gotta go. I gotta work.

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:42.846
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.849
A 50-to-1 underdog
living a Cinderella story,

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:49.686
and he's captured people's imaginations
all over the world.

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:55.984
We love you, Rocky!

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:59.154
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.

01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:01.573
And his record, 44 victories.

01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:04.201
He's had 38 by knockout,
and he's lost 20 fights.

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.661
Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it?

01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:09.414
You know, the stamina and the skill
to last three rounds.

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:11.458
Because Las Vegas odds say no.

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:14.377
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.

01:42:15.087 --> 01:42:16.588
"The Italian Stallion."

01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:20.550
Some meat sign on the back of his robe.
You seen what that was?

01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:22.636
Shamrock Meat...

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.931
There's a lot of noise
coming from the background.

01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:29.059
- They have spotlights.
- I see right back there.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:32.646
Is that the world heavyweight champion,
Apollo Creed?

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:36.733
He's riding in a boat.
Is he supposed to be George Washington?

01:42:36.818 --> 01:42:40.111
Obviously so.
He's got the hat on, the whole thing.

01:42:41.614 --> 01:42:44.157
The world champion, Apollo Creed

01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:47.077
is doing an imitation
of George Washington.

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:49.746
He's throwing money.

01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:53.250
Remember when we were growing up,
we were taught about George Washington

01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:54.793
throwing a dollar.

01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:57.587
If you threw a dollar in those days,
it went a lot farther.

01:42:57.672 --> 01:43:00.382
Now he's taking his...
Blonde wig came off.

01:43:00.466 --> 01:43:02.133
The hat came off.

01:43:03.469 --> 01:43:04.886
I want you!

01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:08.598
The crowd is loving every minute of it.

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:11.726
- Here is the world heavyweight champion.
- Apollo Creed.

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:13.228
For you around the world

01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:16.231
he was dressed as George Washington,
the father of our country.

01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:17.732
I want you!

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:23.989
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
Uncle Sam himself!

01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.574
I want you!

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:28.535
I want all of you!

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.954
He looks like a big flag.

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:33.123
I want you!

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:36.543
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.837
- Is he talking to me?
- Let him talk.

01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:40.714
I want the Stallion!

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:43.633
He says, "I want the Stallion."

01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:48.179
For you in foreign countries,
during World War I,

01:43:48.264 --> 01:43:51.141
the picture of Uncle Sam
with his finger pointed like that

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:53.643
was a recruiting poster
for our fellows in the service,

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.937
the army and the navy. "I want you."

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:58.106
That's what
he's doing a take on.

01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.443
He's yelling, "Creed in three."

01:44:01.527 --> 01:44:03.695
What do you think that outfit cost?

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:16.249
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:20.795
Good evening. A very Happy New Year.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.923
Welcome to Philadelphia.

01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:25.759
Everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:31.389
Time does not permit me
to introduce

01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:34.851
the many luminaries of politics,

01:44:34.936 --> 01:44:39.397
show business and the sporting world
who are with us tonight

01:44:39.732 --> 01:44:41.858
but I would like to present

01:44:41.943 --> 01:44:44.986
one of the immortals of pugilism,

01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:48.740
a champion in and out of the ring,

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:51.576
Philadelphia's own "Smoking Joe,"

01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:54.496
the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!

01:45:05.257 --> 01:45:06.508
How you doing?

01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:08.009
Don't hurt him, okay?

01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:09.719
I'll try not to.

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:12.180
What a credit he's been
in his career as a fighter.

01:45:12.264 --> 01:45:14.391
Now he's coming over
to talk to the champ.

01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:16.935
- Hey, Joe.
- You been ducking me a long time.

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.645
No, Joe. You're next.

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:20.981
- You're next.
- You understand?

01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:23.108
They must be friends.

01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:33.326
Joe Frazier!

01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:35.578
- Fight fans, get settled down.
- Go home!

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:38.832
- Don't stay in the arena!
- It won't be long now.

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:43.753
Now for the main event.

01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:49.050
On my left

01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:52.262
the challenger, in white trunks,

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:55.515
weighing 190 pounds.

01:45:55.599 --> 01:45:58.059
Philadelphia's favorite son,

01:45:58.144 --> 01:46:01.021
The Italian Stallion,

01:46:01.105 --> 01:46:03.189
Rocky Balboa.

01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:12.449
And on my right

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:14.993
wearing red, white and blue,

01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:18.204
weighing 210 pounds,

01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:21.708
undefeated in 46 fights,

01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:24.502
The Master of Disaster,

01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:28.715
the undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world,

01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:30.592
Apollo Creed!

01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:34.929
I want you! You!

01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.435
You, chump. I want you!

01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:43.521
You've both fought in
Philadelphia before. You know the rules.

01:46:43.606 --> 01:46:46.733
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:48.568
Shake hands and come out fighting.

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:50.320
Put your hands up there, chump.

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:52.530
- Come out fighting.
- Come on!

01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:59.454
Rocky's just going over
and being calm, it looks like from here.

01:47:00.581 --> 01:47:02.499
There goes the big hat.

01:47:05.961 --> 01:47:09.506
I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair.

01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:19.891
There's the bell for round one.

01:47:21.352 --> 01:47:25.480
The fighters come in the center of the ring,
looking at each other.

01:47:25.564 --> 01:47:29.025
Creed, the champion,
zipping in those left-handed jabs.

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:31.027
Right there. Bang.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:35.865
The champ stinging the slower challenger
with jabs at will.

01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:39.953
In fact, it looks like Rocky
is blocking the blows with his face.

01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:44.415
The champion doesn't look the best
he's ever been, but he's moving now.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:48.461
The champion's smiling now.
He's toying with him.

01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:52.215
Trying to give the fans
their money's worth.

01:47:53.884 --> 01:47:57.345
He's very clearly outclassed
the challenger right now.

01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:03.434
He's trying to make his man miss like that.

01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:07.564
The champ is just taunting him.

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:12.277
Creed dancing around.

01:48:13.737 --> 01:48:15.530
I don't believe this!

01:48:15.614 --> 01:48:18.032
The champ is down!

01:48:24.165 --> 01:48:25.331
Creed is down!

01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:27.417
What a surprise this is!

01:48:28.586 --> 01:48:31.880
This is the first time the champion
has ever been knocked down.

01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:34.174
The referee is giving him the count.

01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:37.093
Six, seven, eight.

01:48:37.178 --> 01:48:40.138
He appears to be all right.
Glassy-eyed but okay.

01:48:40.472 --> 01:48:43.641
Go to the ribs!
Go to work, Rock!

01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:45.268
Come on!

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.731
Rocky coming back out,
and he's like a bull in a china closet.

01:48:49.815 --> 01:48:52.775
He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.529
The champion's coming off the floor

01:48:56.614 --> 01:48:58.698
and he's trying to put him away.

01:48:58.782 --> 01:49:00.325
A left, a right.

01:49:00.409 --> 01:49:03.870
Combinations into the face!
That's the Apollo we know.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:11.336
Now the champ is taunting Rocky
to come and get some more.

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.046
A left. Another.

01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:15.089
Another left.

01:49:16.508 --> 01:49:18.301
Rocky's coming back!

01:49:19.803 --> 01:49:22.680
Rocky's got him on the ropes!

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:24.974
Let's break it.

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.019
You're holding.

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:29.896
You're posing as a boxer.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.066
There's no way we expected
this kind of hitting.

01:49:40.658 --> 01:49:44.369
Apollo unloading a left.
He's got him up against the ropes.

01:49:52.127 --> 01:49:56.214
They're leading him to his corner.
Rocky can't find his way.

01:49:56.924 --> 01:49:58.299
I called it!

01:49:58.384 --> 01:50:00.927
- Your nose is broke.
- How's it look?

01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:02.512
It's an improvement.

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:05.848
Quit shucking and jiving! Stick and move!

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:09.435
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.937
The guy's quick.

01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:14.816
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:17.610
Finish this bum, and let's go home.

01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:20.989
Stay to the body. You're doing great!

01:50:21.073 --> 01:50:24.284
Round two.
Creed predicted he'd win it in three.

01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:27.954
Creed got knocked down in the first.
He came back strong.

01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:29.998
He's working hard.

01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:33.126
A sharp left. Again, a hard right.

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:35.712
Now coming in.
He's knocked him into the corner again.

01:50:35.796 --> 01:50:38.298
The champion's got him
backed into the corner.

01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:42.343
Pummeling him left and right,
his head bouncing against the ropes.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:46.264
Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.

01:50:46.348 --> 01:50:49.934
Battering him like a punching bag.
What's keeping him up?

01:50:52.271 --> 01:50:53.730
Can't you fight?

01:50:53.814 --> 01:50:57.066
Stop clowning around
and give the people something!

01:50:57.735 --> 01:51:00.069
- Come on!
- He says he wants more!

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:02.947
He wants more. You folks
watching television around the world

01:51:03.032 --> 01:51:05.074
you're watching a battle.

01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:13.166
Balboa trying to fight back.
Oh, he tagged the champ!

01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:16.753
The champion is trying to get out of there,
but he can't do it.

01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:20.715
He is being barraged with lefts and rights
to the head and body.

01:51:20.799 --> 01:51:24.093
Balboa is tagging the champion
right on the kisser!

01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:28.514
The referee steps in.
They're ready to keep going.

01:51:28.932 --> 01:51:30.767
Back to your corners!

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:33.269
Come on, Creed!

01:51:34.063 --> 01:51:36.272
This is gonna be a tough one.

01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:33.287
- Back with a left!
- He got tagged!

01:52:34.873 --> 01:52:37.458
The referee's wiping off the gloves.

01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:44.966
Hard left and right combination!

01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:48.010
- What is keeping him up, Bill?
- I don't know.

01:52:49.972 --> 01:52:53.224
He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself.

01:53:00.691 --> 01:53:02.733
Down! Stay down!

01:53:02.818 --> 01:53:05.153
Apollo has his arms in the air!

01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:17.331
Five.

01:53:18.584 --> 01:53:19.709
Six.

01:53:20.252 --> 01:53:21.461
Seven.

01:53:21.545 --> 01:53:22.712
Eight.

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:24.213
Nine.

01:53:31.096 --> 01:53:32.388
Come on!

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.641
Apollo can't believe it.

01:53:52.409 --> 01:53:55.620
The champion got a left to his right ribs.

01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:58.247
This has been a tremendous...

01:54:04.004 --> 01:54:05.171
Okay, champ?

01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:06.547
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:54:06.632 --> 01:54:09.258
I may have broke my ribs.

01:54:09.343 --> 01:54:11.802
I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye.

01:54:11.887 --> 01:54:13.804
- Cut me.
- Don't wanna do it.

01:54:13.889 --> 01:54:16.390
- Go ahead. Cut me.
- Okay.

01:54:16.475 --> 01:54:18.017
Try it. Cut it.

01:54:18.477 --> 01:54:20.353
Creed! Creed!

01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:23.523
Oh, God.

01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:26.400
You're bleeding inside.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

01:54:26.485 --> 01:54:29.779
You ain't stopping nothing, man.

01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:32.448
You stop this fight, I'll kill you!

01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:35.993
- I'm going.
- If you wanna go.

01:54:37.246 --> 01:54:39.580
You gotta give it all!

01:54:39.665 --> 01:54:41.624
You gotta get him!

01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:49.006
The 15th and final round.

01:54:49.091 --> 01:54:52.134
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:54:57.975 --> 01:55:00.601
They look like they've been in a war.

01:55:08.193 --> 01:55:11.571
A hard right.
The champion really tagged him.

01:55:11.655 --> 01:55:15.658
Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

01:55:19.037 --> 01:55:20.830
Body punches!

01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:24.333
Hard lefts and rights. Look at the blood
coming out of his mouth!

01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:26.544
He's spitting up blood now.

01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:32.508
A tremendous right hand by Rocky.

01:55:32.593 --> 01:55:33.968
Go for it, Rock!

01:55:34.052 --> 01:55:37.054
- Listen to this crowd!
- Right to the ribs.

01:55:37.139 --> 01:55:39.432
Another to the ribs. That left hand again.

01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:42.768
Right to the jaw!
He's got him up against the ropes!

01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:44.979
Apollo the champ...

01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:51.193
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.362
Don't want one.

01:56:03.874 --> 01:56:06.792
Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.
How do you feel?

01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:09.378
- All right.
- What were you thinking about...

01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:12.131
- Adrian!
...coming out for the 15th round?

01:56:12.215 --> 01:56:13.466
Adrian!

01:56:15.469 --> 01:56:16.594
Rocky!

01:56:20.932 --> 01:56:22.808
- Tonight...
- Rocky!

01:56:22.893 --> 01:56:25.895
...we have had the privilege of witnessing

01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:29.607
the greatest exhibition of boxing stamina

01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:31.817
in the history of the ring.

01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:33.444
Adrian!

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:35.446
Rocky!

01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:38.407
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:41.327
we have a split decision.

01:56:42.537 --> 01:56:43.954
Judge Walker

01:56:47.417 --> 01:56:48.793
for Creed!

01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:52.672
Adrian!

01:56:52.756 --> 01:56:56.258
- Your fans want a rematch.
- Ain't gonna be no rematch!

01:56:58.095 --> 01:56:59.845
- Adrian!
- You heard him...

01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:03.015
- You can't go in there!
- That's my friend. Let go!

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.601
- You're wrecking the jacket!
- Rocky!

01:57:05.686 --> 01:57:08.312
- Paulie.
- Adrian!

01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:15.194
I love you!

01:57:18.824 --> 01:57:21.367
- I love you!
- I love you!

01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:23.035
I love you!

01:57:24.305 --> 01:58:24.849
